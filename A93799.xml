            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>An Advertiſement to the</hi> READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, be pleaſed to take notice that this diſcourſe here preſented to thine eye, was (for ſome principal parts of it) only at firſt intended for, and ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the ears of a Countrey Auditory: and this I doubt not but thou wilt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily (eſpecially, if thine eye be any thing curious) diſcern by the homelineſſe of its dreſſe; here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no <hi>rhetorical flouriſhes,</hi> or <hi>ſtudied obſcurities,</hi> to pleaſe thy fancy, or exerciſe thy Wit: <hi>Nobis non licet eſſe tam diſertis;</hi> neither the condition of the Hearers, nor my own ability, would permit me to be thus eloquent. And indeed, though I am far either from approving rudeneſſe of ſpeech in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred matters, or envying thoſe abilities of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in others which I cannot attain unto my ſelf: yet I am of opinion, that wholſom meats may be too much ſweetned, and thereby loſe much of their wholſomneſſe or nouriſhing vertue: and in like manner, that ſolid and material truths may be too artificially decked, ſo as ſuch art or decking ſhall come to be more regarded then the truths themſelves: and conſequently, the ears rather be thereby tickled, then the underſtanding convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or the heart affected.</p>
            <p>The truth that is here held forth in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe (I mean, eſpecially in the popular parts of it) and more fully confirmed in the annexed <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:169709:3"/>is (I conceive) one of that rank, that is, ſuch a plain and important truth as would rather ſeem leſs ſerious, &amp; be made to abate of its proper efficacie, then be any thing advanced by an affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>wiſdom of words,</hi> or human eloquence. It is not other but what the Apoſt long ſince affirmed; that <hi>without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God:</hi> or to deliver it in words more ſignificant of my own ſenſe, <hi>that a holy life is the only way, and that which is ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make a man bleſſed in and after death.</hi> A truth ſo clear, and withall of ſo good a ſound, that moſt (I doubt not) at the firſt view or hearing will readily grant it: and indeed it is commended to us by ſo unqueſtionable and full a light, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that it may be a wonder how any ſhould ſee cauſe to deny, or doubt of it; and ſo, in both theſe reſpects, it may ſeem a taſk unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which I have herein undertaken, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to a belief thereof.</p>
            <p>And yet indeed the matter is far otherwiſe: for there is nothing I know, at this day, pretending to be a divine truth, more generally diſcredited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians of all ſorts, then this is: though I think there is ſcarce any thing (ſuppoſing it for a truth) wherein it concerns them ſo much to be firmly perſwaded, as in the belief of it; it being hardly probable, that any will act according to it, but who are ſo perſwaded of it; that is, that they will univerſally compoſe their lives to thoſe divine rules of holineſſe laid down in the Goſpel (which generally are ſo contrary to mens ſenſual deſires, and their worldly eaſe and intereſts) unleſſe they be truly convinced of a neceſſity of ſo doing. I will not deny, but that moſt who profeſſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> profeſſe alſo a kinde of confuſed belief of this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: and I ſhall alſo grant, that it ſeems to be the deſigne of moſt preachers to keep up this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb facs="tcp:169709:3"/>in men, and thereby to plant ſuch holineſſe in them; there being hardly any of that calling, who does not in one manner or other bend their diſcourſes towards this end.</p>
            <p>But yet, as we ſay of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that what they grant directly and in words, they do indirectly and really deny; as (not to mention other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular points) when they profeſſe to acknowledge <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the head of the Church, and yet hold the <hi>Pope</hi> alſo (though as they pretend, under <hi>Chriſt</hi>) to be head thereof, aſcribing ſuch a power to him and his Chair in ſacred matters as in effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives <hi>Chriſt</hi> of his headſhip, and renders a great part of his laws invalid and without any force: So I think it may without breach of charity be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of too many <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> both Miniſters and people, that notwithſtanding the preaching of the former, and profeſſed belief of both in this point; holineſſe of life, deſcribed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſo as it is in the Goſpel, is held and reputed by them a thing unneceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>What elſe does that general diſuſe and neglect of thoſe many plain duties confeſſedly required of us in the Goſpel, imply? yea, what elſe do thoſe common doctrines and perſwaſions, publikely owned and ſetled in mens mindes, declare? as namely, touching the ſufficiency of <hi>Chriſts</hi> merits and righteouſneſſe being meerly <hi>apprehended</hi> and <hi>applyed</hi> to a mans ſoul, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is (in the account of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) the formality of that faith whereby we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in the ſight of God: &amp; alſo touching the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of late contrition, or mourning for ſin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as many make repentance in a manner wholly to conſiſt. Both which are things that may be truly tranſacted (as the nature of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves imply, and as the patrons of them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) by ſuch perſons at their going out of the
<pb facs="tcp:169709:4"/>world, as all the time of their living in it before, have conſtantly allowed themſelves in known breaches of ſome or more of the divine laws of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do not theſe two doctrines or opinions truly contradict and overthrow that other opinion ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally profeſſed, and ſeemingly held, <hi>of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a holy life for coming to the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi> Can a thing in any ſenſe be reputed the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means for attaining ſome end, when the ſaid end may be <hi>ordinarily</hi> come at without theſe means by ſome other way? as by the force of the foreſaid opinions men are taught to believe, that eternal ſalvation may be certainly attained by them, though they never lived holily, if ſo be that now when they are a dying they do (as it is then poſſible for them) apply <hi>Chriſts</hi> righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to themſelves, and truly mourn for their ſins: or is not this (at beſt) to hold forth two wayes to the kingdom of heaven? one, that which is ſeemingly believed, and which indeed the <hi>Scripture</hi> only allowes and approves of, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſtrict and proportionable long way of a <hi>holy life;</hi> and the other, that which is much eaſier and ſhorter, to wit, <hi>mourning for ſin at the laſt, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciary application of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to a mans ſelf,</hi> as that which will be fully effectual without the former preceding? And is there any likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood or reaſon to expect, but that (this being ſo) men ſhould generally (as we ſee they do) take this latter way, and ſuffer the former to lye quite untrodden and diſuſed? All (we know) are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lovers of eaſe, and deſirous (if poſſible) to reconcile the enjoyment of the pleaſures of ſin with the hopes of thoſe true pleaſures hereafter to be enjoyed: and therefore it is no marvel, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught (as, in effect, by the former opinion
<pb facs="tcp:169709:4"/>they are) that there is no abſolute neceſſity of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving holily, &amp; ſo that theſe latter are poſſible to be come at by thoſe who never truly and effectually relinquiſhed the former, the moſt every where ſecurely allow themſelves this liberty.</p>
            <p>This (I mean, this <hi>perſwaſion</hi> rooted in mens mindes through the foreſaid opinions, <hi>that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſts laws is not required in the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of neceſſity, or indiſpenſably for attaining ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>) is that which truly enervates, for the moſt part the force of all preaching and divine exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to holineſſe of life; that which makes ſuch preaching and exhortation how powerfully ſoever otherwiſe enforced, available only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in men <hi>flaſhes of devotion, or a partial piety, or ſome vellieties, and faint ineffectual endeavours of living holily:</hi> this is that which makes men willing (for better excuſing their own voluntary ſloth) to interpret the habitual obſerving of the <hi>laws of Chriſt,</hi> which yet they cannot but acknowledge the Scripture ſeems to require, ſuch a height of perfection as is <hi>not poſſible</hi> to be reached unto; and therefore, they think, <hi>not neceſſary</hi> to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured after: in brief, this is that (I conceive) which of all things moſt deeply contributes to the upholding of the dominion of ſin in the world, both for the extent and degrees of it: I mean, among the profeſſours of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and ſo by its influence helps forward daily the <hi>perdition of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſouls.</hi> The apprehenſion of all which evils, and eſpecially of the laſt, which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of them all, hath made me think that I could not poſſibly do a more charitable work, then uſe that ability (how weak or ſmall ſoever) which God hath given me, towards the diſcovering of that which is the true root of them; which, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is no other, but that before mentioned,
<pb facs="tcp:169709:5"/>namely, <hi>this common but corrupt perſwaſion, that there is ſome other way of coming to the kingdom of heaven, then by a holy life, or the habitual obſerving of the laws of Chriſt.</hi> And this, accordingly, I have endeavoured in this following tract: partly, in the <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> as the words whereunto it is limited caſt me upon it, and the condition of the hearers required; but more fully in the annexed <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix:</hi> the deſigne of both which is to ſhow, that which I conceive it infinitely concerns all men to be firmly perſwaded of, namely, that the former manner of obſerving the <hi>foreſaid laws</hi> is an <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſable condition</hi> for attaining of eternal life. A <hi>truth,</hi> which as I am fully convinced of, for my own part; ſo I cannot but think there is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity lying upon me, to do my utmoſt for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of others into a like belief of it: being firmly perſwaded, that ſuch a belief thereof once throughly ſetled in mens mindes, would be at once effectual for ſtopping thoſe gaps of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and ſo of perdition, that now lye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; and alſo for enabling men to exhibit actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their performance a greater height of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in reference to <hi>Chriſts laws,</hi> then yet they have ever had ſo much as a ſerious thought of aiming after.</p>
            <p>There are ſome other things of another nature inſiſted on in the following diſcourſe; ſuch as I conceive were not ſo fit to offer to the ears of thoſe who were hearers of the other parts, as they may be to preſent to the eyes of ſome who may now be willing to be readers: and theſe things perhaps, as they are connexed with the other, may make the ſtructure of the whole ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what uneven and diſproportioned: but yet, being uſeful in their way, as I hope in ſome degree they may prove, and having the ſame ground for their

            <p>My main aim in the whole, (if my own heart deceive me not) is this that <hi>Christ</hi> may have the honour of that obedience which is due to him, and which he requires; and Chriſtians the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of that reward which they hope for from him, and which is limited only to ſuch obedience: that theſe may not wretchedly delude themſelves in their moſt large hopes, nor wickedly defraud him of his unqueſtioned right, by a formal and fruitleſſe profeſſion. This is that great errand on which this little work is ſent forth: and I beſeech <hi>that God,</hi> who by mean and contemptible inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſeth ſometimes to effect great matters, to proſper it therein, and to convert all to his own Glory.</p>

In brief, it appears from the ſecond and third verſes going before, that ſome falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers among theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whom he had before ſharply threatned,

               <p>Touching the firſt of theſe, namely, that there is a warfare, &amp;c. it may appear hence, Becauſe our duty is expreſt by ſuch tearms as are proper to war; as Fighting,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.12. 2 Tim. 4.7. Luke 3.24. Epheſ. 6.12. Jude 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Fight the good fight, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>I have fought</hi> &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>There are ſeveral things belonging to Warre;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some as the <hi>ground</hi> or <hi>occaſion</hi> of it, namely <hi>enemies,</hi> which oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo as either to deprive men of that whereof they are already poſſeſt, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from that which they have a right to, or deſire to attain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some as <hi>means,</hi> to manage it aright, ſo as the deſign of theſe enemies may not take effect; but that by the uſe of theſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169709:11"/>means they may overcome them, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to themſelves thoſe things the ſaid enemies labour to deprive and hinder them of.</p>
               <p>Now, for the enemies in war, they are uſually many, but they may be all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily compriz'd under one Head or <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;</hi> And for the means, they are either ſuch as are to be uſed before the fight, and they may be compriz'd under that which is called the <hi>diſcipline of war,</hi> whereby Souldiers are wont to be exerciſed and prepared before hand; or elſe ſuch as are eſpecially uſed, and of whom there is need in time of fighting. And they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch as a man is to have in him, as namely a good eye, and a good heart; or upon him, and about him, as wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</p>
               <p>Now in all theſe our Chriſtian courſe has a true agreement with war.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have <hi>enemies,</hi> multitudes and millions of them, many infernal ſpirits, many wicked men, many naturall inbred luſts and deſires; the joynt deſigne of all whoſe enmity is, to deprive us of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (that great Good, which we all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, and profeſſe to labour for) either by keeping, or turning us out of the way
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169709:12"/>that leads thither. And all theſe though ſo many and manifold in themſelves; yet they may be ranked under one <hi>General,</hi> the great adverſary of God and our Souls, the Devil; He is call'd <hi>the Prince of the Air,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.2. 2 Cor. 4.4.</note> and <hi>the God of this world, that works in the hearts of the children of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> acting not only in them, by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his ſuggeſtions entertain'd, to their own ruine; but alſo by them, by uſing them as his inſtruments, for effecting or attempting the perdition of others. Hereupon <hi>Peter</hi> was reproved by his Name, becauſe he was (though unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly) his inſtrument,
<note place="margin">Matth. 16.22, 23.</note> in that counſel given by him to our <hi>Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that we may be the better able to reſiſt, and overcome him, we have need to be acquainted with his nature, and the courſe he takes to oppoſe us: his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (ſo far as is pertinent to this matter) is beſt ſet forth by the name of <hi>Satan</hi> or <hi>adverſary,</hi> whereby is ſignified, one that is wholly bent to overthrow us: This is his deſigne, this the end that he aims at, and that ſtill while we are here in this world he is going about.</p>
               <p>Now the wayes he takes to do this, are repreſented to us by two other names of his.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:169709:12"/>1. That of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> or <hi>old Serpent,</hi> which you know is a ſubtle creature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That of a <hi>Dragon,</hi> and <hi>a Lion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 12.9.20 2. 1 Pet. 5.8.</note> or <hi>roaring Lion,</hi> both which are very cruel and devouring creatures.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the former is imply'd his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the manifold artifices he uſes for this end: and indeed they are ſo many, that they cannot eaſily be found out, or numbred; only ſome of the moſt general I ſhall note.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes applying himſelf chiefly to the underſtanding. He comes under the viſour of Religion, in the habit, and it may be in the perſon of a preacher, ſuggeſting to men (from ſome places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> ſeemingly ſpeaking that which they deſire ſhould be true) ſome ſuch opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as are indeed moſt favourable to the fleſh, but moſt falſe in themſelves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to their ſouls; ſuch as that is, the generality every where are poſſeſt with, namely <hi>that to rely on the merits of Chriſt is all that is required of them:</hi> that God will at laſt for his ſake accept and crown them, though now either they take no care at all of doing his will, or content themſelves with ſome faint purpoſes and ineffectual endeavours about it: this is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169709:13"/>that artifice, wherwith he takes and holds faſt the multitude. But it is not from any true ground in Scripture, which every where ſpeaks of <hi>doing the will of God, and keeping his Commandments, and being new Creatures,</hi> and that, as neceſſary conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of obtaining ſalvation: it is only the compliance it hath to mens natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, the deſire they have it ſhould be true, that makes them ſo readily believe it is ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes applving himſelf to the will and affections: he deals with us, as he dealt with our <hi>Saviour,</hi> when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him the <hi>Kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</hi> that is, he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt; to our minds, the pleaſures, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and advantages that are here to be had, by giving the rains to our deſires and contrarily, the hardſhips, troubles, and difficulties that are likely to befall us, by tying our ſelves to a religious courſe; that the former are preſent, and certain; but the other, namely, the rewards of our Religion, are yet to come, and uncertain, and it may be, not worth the parting with thoſe, and therefore it is good to enjoy them while they are to be had, and to lay aſide the care of theſe things, which (if
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169709:13"/>there be any ſuch) are yet farre off.</p>
               <p>And to make theſe ſuggeſtions more effectual, he hath not only multitudes of examples alwayes in readineſſe (that is, of ſuch as truly <hi>walk after the fleſh,</hi> making it all, or their main care to fulfill the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of it,) to preſent to our eyes: but alſo many other artifices to work upon us, as namely by preſenting to our mindes ſome eaſy way, as he did to our <hi>Saviour, Onely fall down, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 4.9.</note> or by poſſeſſing us with a perſwaſion, that Honour and Happineſs conſiſts in thoſe things; and that contempt, or danger, or poverty, or hatred, are like to be the attendants of thoſe that follow after heavenly things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beſides this <hi>Serpentine</hi> cunning, he has alſo the cruelty of a <hi>dragon,</hi> or <hi>lion:</hi> and this not only in reſpect of the end; for ſo this cruelty he alwayes exerciſes: (when he is moſt an angel, that is, in regard of the means by him made uſe of, he is ſtill a devil, aiming at our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as his end) but alſo in the means he uſeth: when by flattery, or the lure of profits, and worldly pleaſures he cannot prevail, then he ſtirs himſelf to raiſe up ſtorms of perſecutions, terrours
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169709:14"/>without, and terrours within: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times putting it into the hearts of the wicked, his inſtruments, to reproach or moleſt, and often perſecute even to death, thoſe that ſet themſelves to obey God; and other times raiſing terrifying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing thoughts within themſelves, to make their lives, and the way they are in, bitter to them, that ſo they may grow weary of it. Many other things might be added, but this is enough to ſhew the firſt thing, which is the ground of all War, namely, that we have an enemy, a <hi>cunning, cruel, powerful enemie,</hi> ſo that its neceſſary we ſhould be warriours, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we will give up our ſelves as a prey to deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The things required to war, as the means to mannage it, are 1. That which is requir'd before-hand, as namely, <hi>the diſcipline of war.</hi> Souldiers, before they engage with the enemy, have ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily their Trainings; and when they lie neer to him, uſe to be very watchfull in keeping their Guards, and ſending out Scouts: ſo there is a certain diſcipline wherein we are to be employ'd, in the managing of our Chriſtian warfare, and it is chiefly to be proportioned to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169709:14"/>temper and condition of our adverſary, that is, to the <hi>cunning</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> that he is compoſed of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then; as one part of his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, to corrupt our underſtandings, to poſſeſſe us with an erroneous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſpecially in matters which moſt neerly concern our ſalvation: ſo our care muſt be, to have <hi>our ſenſes ſo exerciſed</hi> as to be able to diſtinguiſh betwixt good and evil, betwixt that which is ſound and that which is unſound in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>Now this we can only attain unto, by attending diligently unto the word, by giving earneſt heed unto thoſe things which this <hi>Oracle of Truth</hi> commends to us. For the right underſtanding of which, we muſt know, that though there be ſome things hard to be underſtood, and which <hi>the ignorant and unſtable wreſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.16.</note> yet the greateſt part, eſpecially thoſe which immediately concern our practiſe and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whereupon our ſalvation chiefly and immediately depends, are plain and eaſie to be diſcerned: ſo plain indeed, that it is not poſſible for men to apprehend them in any other ſenſe, then what of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them, unleſſe they will either be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169709:15"/>oſcitant and careleſſe readers, or wilfully ſhut their eyes, and ſuffer themſelves to be carryed blindfold by others; or laſtly, ſet themſelves to wreſt things to ſuch a ſenſe, as their own ſenſual affections moſt incline them to.</p>
               <p>And therefore, that you neither abuſe your ſelves, nor ſuffer your ſelves to be abuſed by others in this kind, I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you theſe two rules to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by you in this matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To take heed you ſuffer not your affections to corrupt your judgement: that is, that this be not the ground of your believing this or that to be the ſence of Scripture, namely, your deſires that it ſhould be ſo; as that, which allowes you moſt liberty in your ſins, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort with them. There is a ſaying, <hi>as the fool thinketh, ſo the bell clinketh:</hi> and the meaning of it is verified here: moſt men, according to their carnal wiſhes, and hopes they allow in themſelves, are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to conceive the meaning of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God</hi> in Scripture: But as this Spirit is moſt contrary, in it ſelf, to the temper of that carnal part in us, ſo there cannot ordinarily be a better argument, whereon to ſuſpect or believe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169709:15"/>of any opinion, or ſuppoſed ſence of Scripture, then this, namely, <hi>a natural and general forwardneſſe in men to believe it:</hi> for the moſt (we know) are lovers of eaſe, and ſenſuall pleaſures; and therefore deſire, if it may be, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all the Scripture in ſuch a ſence as may together with the hopes of Heaven, allow them the enjoyment of theſe; though they are things, that are not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fible to be reconciled with one another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So firmly to believe, and reſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of that which you finde clearly affirm'd in Scripture, as not to ſuffer your ſelves to be made to ſuſpect the plain meaning of it, by the ſeeming oppoſition of ſome other places, whoſe meaning is not ſo clear: but contrarily, to bring thoſe that are more obſcure to be interpreted by the rule of theſe. As it is certain, there is no true oppoſition betwixt places of Scripture; ſo it is as certain, that God in his wiſdom hath thought fit to permit ſome appearing oppoſition: and that on purpoſe (we may conceive) for exerciſing of our diligence, to make us more intent in the reading of his word. Now, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we muſt conceive, that the fewer and darker places are to be underſtood by the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169709:16"/>more and clearer: as for example; The Scripture, every where almoſt, abounds with ſuch ſayings as theſe, that <hi>we are not to be only hearers of the word, but doers of it;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1.22. Matth. 7.26 Heb. 12.14. Gal. 6.15. 1 Cor. 7.19. Rom. 2.7.</note> That <hi>He that hears and does not, is like a fooliſh builder;</hi> That <hi>without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God;</hi> That <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus nothing availeth but a new creature; Nothing but keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God;</hi> That <hi>Immortality and eternal Life ſhall be conferred upon thoſe that by patient continuance in well doing look for it, &amp;c.</hi> by all which, the abſolute neceſſity of a conſtant and continued obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>Laws of Chriſt,</hi> is either expreſly, or at leaſt implicitly aſſerted. Again, there are ſome other Texts, that ſeem to make this thing not ſo neceſſary, but that a man may be ordinarily ſaved without it: as where it is ſaid, only <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Acts 16.31.</note> and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Now who ſees not, that there is a neceſſity of bringing this laſt Text to a conformity with the former? that is, thus; Though <hi>believing</hi> properly be only an act of the will, and together therewith of the underſtanding, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie here a reliance upon Chriſt, yet it muſt be ſuch a reliance as includes <hi>in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169709:16"/>very nature of it</hi> a performance of the former duties, that is, a doing of thoſe things which he hath expreſly required of us in his word; without which, any reliance upon him for ſalvation muſt needs be preſumptuous and unwarrantable?</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reference to that <hi>other</hi> part of <hi>cunning</hi> which the devil uſes principally towards our wills or affections, as</p>
               <p n="1">1. By ſuggeſting to us the pleaſures and profits of this world, in their luſtre: and by perſwading us to doubt of the future.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt deliberately conſider of the great vanity and tranſitorineſſe of theſe preſent pleaſures and profits: what price ſoever he ſets upon them,
<note place="margin">Eccles. 1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, they are <hi>vanitie of vanities:</hi> and our own experience may confirm us in this belief: How many do we ſee and hear of daily, that are taken away in the midſt of their enjoyment of them? and how certain is it that all muſt leave them? and what comfort can they afford a man when his ſoul is call'd for? who can carry any of theſe things along with him? or what profit will then accrue to a man of all theſe enjoyments? will they not all then be gone as a ſhadow, &amp; be as though
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169709:17"/>they never had been? and will it not be a miſerable exchange, to enjoy for a few dayes the ſweetneſſe of theſe, and then for ever afterwards to lie down in hell, under eternal anguiſh and vexation? for ſuch indeed (if we may believe the word) is certain to be the condition of thoſe that ſo eſteem and follow theſe worldly pleaſures and profits, as for the enjoyment of them willingly to neglect any of the Commandments of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt anſwerably labour to ſettle our minds in a ſteady belief of thoſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though yet unſeen, pleaſures men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the Goſpel: by conſidering, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the greatneſſe and laſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them, thoſe infallible grounds wheron we may certainly expect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them. <hi>God,</hi> that cannot lie, hath promiſed them; the <hi>Son of God,</hi> that knew no ſin, hath been the publiſher of them, and by his miracles and death confirm'd them; and is already, as our forerunner, gone to take poſſeſſion of them, and has now fully put into his hands the power of diſpenſing them to us; the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and many others ſince, have willingly laid down their lives, and ſo parted with all the comforts of this world
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169709:17"/>at once, out of a certain belief and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of them; And that, which is (as it were) a continued ſtanding miracle till our dayes, The <hi>Jews,</hi> that were once Gods peculiar people, but became Chriſts profeſt and implacable enemies, for their rejecting of him, and ſo together with him, that doctrine with he ſo taught and confirmed, remain ſtill under the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible marks of Gods diſpleaſure; being baniſht out of that land wherein he by his own Hand had miraculouſly plac't them, and ſo continue a diſperſed, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious, and hated people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The devil uſes for making his ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions more effectual, to make uſe of the examples, and it may be the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of worldly men. The way of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe he repreſents to us, as a forlorn, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary way (ſo as they of <hi>Rome</hi> have uſed to repreſent our Church) that has but a few travailers in it: the other, he ſhews us to be a way much beaten; multitudes, droves of all ſorts going on in it: and why then ſhould we affect to be ſingular? why ſhould we not rather go along with the crowd; venture, and fare as well as they do?</p>
               <p>Againſt this <hi>artefice</hi> of his, we muſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169709:18"/>get our minds poſſeſt with an ill opinion of the world, of the faſhions and uſes of it, in reſpect of religion: and it is not uncharitableneſſe, but wiſdom for us ſo to do. S. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that <hi>the whole world lies in wickedneſſe,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>in the wicked one:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 5.19</note> he is called the Prince of it; the greateſt part whereof willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do him ſervice: and that becauſe his ſervice is ſo eaſie and pleaſing to the fleſh for the preſent; it is nothing for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, but to pamper the fleſh, to ſeek and ſet our mindes and employ our care about thoſe things that this world affords, that are here to be had. What marvel then is it, conſidering the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of men to theſe things, if the greateſt part every where are ſuch as he would have them; fulfilling his will, while they ſo ſatisfie their own deſires: and ſo be very unfit examples for any hereupon to conform unto? yea thoſe that would provide ſecurely for their ſouls, muſt ſo far avoid this ſnare of the devil, as not only to think it unſafe for them to go along with the World, that is, the greateſt part, in their faſhions and courſes, but even to think themſelves bound to go againſt the ſtream, to aim at
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169709:18"/>ſuch a ſingularity, as is quite oppoſite to this general practiſe. <hi>Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed in the renewing of your mindes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12.2. Phil. 3.20. Jam. 4.4.</note> and <hi>our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in heaven,</hi> that is, the heart of a right Chriſtian is there ſet. Whereas the moſt, whom the Prophet calls the <hi>men of this world</hi> (as having no other portion, that is, of good things,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 17.14.</note> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but what they enjoy here) have their hearts ſet upon earthly things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The devil may perhaps make uſe of the perſwaſions of others, ſuch as are in appearance, and it may be in their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, friends; to draw thoſe off, that are entred into the way of godlineſſe, and have broken his ſnare: thus he did make uſe of <hi>Peter</hi> to Chriſt; and thus many times (no doubt) he does of thoſe, that in their carnal affections wiſh others well perhaps: putting into their mouths ſuch words as theſe, <hi>what needs all this ado? why ſhould you trouble your ſelves with ſo much reading, or praying, or meditating, or conferring together,</hi> cannot you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your ſelves as others do, with what is done in publike? what neceſſity is there, that you ſhould be ſo preciſe in your carriage, ſo ſcrupulous and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169709:19"/>in your words? do not you think that others as wiſe as you, that make no ſuch matter of theſe things?</p>
               <p>Thus, I doubt not but many times it falls out. But whoſoever you are that are thus aſſaulted, and thus ſet upon, to have you abate of your zeal and care about the <hi>things of the kingdom of Heaven,</hi> (which hath need of all helps, in this cold and frozen world, for encreaſing it) you are to look upon the perſons employed in this work (though they be as near to you as <hi>Peter</hi> was to Chriſt, yea though it ſhould be one that lies in your boſom) as the inſtruments of <hi>Satan,</hi> that is, ſuch as (at leaſt, unwittingly) are his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doing that which tends truly to your deſtruction: and therefore let it be your care, that the love you have to the parties, or the apprehenſion of that which they bear to you, corrupt you not ſo far (as eaſily it may) as to make you hearken to ſuch counſels, in abating of the performance of thoſe duties, which are ſo neceſſary. You are to remember that leſſon of our Saviours in this caſe, <hi>If any man hate not father and mother he cannot be my diſciple.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 14.26</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As the devil is <hi>cunning,</hi> ſo is he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169709:19"/>alſo <hi>cruel;</hi> one that not only makes uſe of gentle and flattering means, but alſo of rough and harſh uſage; and therefore we muſt fit out preparation hereunto alſo.</p>
               <p>We muſt inure our ſelves beforehand to hardneſs,
<note place="margin">2 Tit. 2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou therefore as a good ſouldier of Jeſus Chriſt, endure hardneſs:</hi> Souldiers, when they enter into the field, or come to be ingag'd, are forced to indure much hardneſs; cold, and wet, and hard lodging, and to be content with courſe and ſcant dyet: and therefore, they that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to approve themſelves good ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers indeed in this kinde, will be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſo wiſe as to innure themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand to ſome ſuch hardſhip; at leaſt, thoſe that have the command and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of them, will not ſuffer them to ſpend their time in eaſe and idleneſſe, or in the ſoftning pleaſures of feaſting and delicate feeding.</p>
               <p>The like wiſdom is requir'd in us: we are ſure through the oppoſition of this great adverſary, to meet with hardneſſe, troubles within, or without or both; and therefore we muſt prepare our ſelves before-hand for this hardneſſe, by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly undergoing ſome hardneſſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:169709:20"/>
               <p>Now by this hardneſſe, I mean nothing elſe, but the doing of thoſe things which are naturally hard and unpleaſing to us, together with the croſſing our ſelves in thoſe things which our ſenſual part car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries us to.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which I underſtand by the former, is the conſtant and continued u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe Chriſtian exerciſes of <hi>prayer, meditation, exhortation,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>fasting:</hi> all which are commonly (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at firſt) ungrateful to the fleſh, but very requiſite for hardning it, and making it ſerviceable to the ſpirit, and ſo for ſtrengthening of us to hold out in this Warfare.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which I underſtand by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, namely, by croſſing our ſelves in thoſe things which our ſenſual part carries us to, 'tis not any <hi>Stoical</hi> irrational oppoſing of our deſires, in the uſe of things which the temper of our bodily conſtitution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and which God hath allowed us ſo far to ſatisfie: but it is the inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe deſires, which many times are very pleaſing, and therefore hard to be moderated: and ſuch are the deſires of revenge, or of expreſſing anger, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: which we are ſo far to oppoſe in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169709:20"/>our ſelves, by the <hi>Law of Chriſt,</hi> as not only not to wiſh or take pleaſure in any evil that befalls him that hath done us wrong, or is our profeſt enemie, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven truly to wiſh and ſeek his good.</p>
               <p>And in regard of this kinde of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it is, that our Chriſtian duties are expreſt by ſuch names as imply a kinde of violence to be uſed againſt our ſelves;
<note place="margin">Col. 3.5. Gal. 5.24. Matth. 5.29.30.</note> as <hi>mortifying our earthly members: cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying the fleſh: pulling out the right eye, cutting off the right hand, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by this croſſing our ſelves in this kinde, by ſubduing that anger or pride, or covetouſneſſe, or other the like ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual affection that is yet in us, we ſhall take out the ſting from all other croſſes, that the devil by any of his inſtruments can bring upon us.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, one thing not the leaſt effectual to prepare thee for this hardneſſe, ſo as to make thee go thorough with thy Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Warfare, will be, to ſettle this perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in thy ſelf, namely, that though thou mayeſt certainly by ſo going on, promiſe thy ſelf victory in the end, and alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily much comfort for the preſent, even in the exerciſes of religion, or <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods commandments,</hi> according to that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169709:21"/>of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>in keeping of them there is great reward:</hi> &amp; <hi>a hundred fold now in this preſent time</hi> is promiſed by our Saviour:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.11 Mark 10.30</note> yet thou muſt expect through this adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries means, ſeveral rubs and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to be now and then caſt in thy way; and that, not onely by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and perſecutions of others, but (which is moſt bitter and dangerous of all) ſome perplexing diſtracting thoughts within thy ſelf, ſo that all thy ſenſe of pleaſure ſhall be taken away; and that courſe which hitherto thou haſt gone on in, ſhall appear in thy own apprehenſion, not only tedious, but an unprofitable and uncomfortable courſe. This (I ſay) thou art to reckon of afore-hand, that thou mayeſt be the better prepared for it, and not think it any ſtrange thing, when thou findeſt thy ſelf in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Only, when it is ſo with thee, thou muſt temember ſtill, to hold faſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 74.1.</note> that <hi>God is good to them that fear him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4.18.</note> to <hi>believe in hope againſt hope,</hi> and againſt ſenſe of what thou feeleſt, for the preſent: though he hide his face for a a while, he will again ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if thou continueſt to look for him in well doing. And therefore, if he ſhall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169709:21"/>ſtay, <hi>wait for him, for he will certainly come, and will not tarry;</hi> not tarry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his own appointed time,
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.37.</note> yea not beyond that time when his coming may be truly moſt for thy advantage: His withdrawing himſelf in this kinde, is but to try whether thou wilt wait, whether thy faith be of that temper which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> was of, to believe beyond ſenſe; whether, with the Prophet,
<note place="margin">Iſai. 30.18.</note> thou wilt ſay, <hi>I will ſeek the Lord that hideth his face from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the time of fighting, two things are required, 1. <hi>A good Eye.</hi> 2. <hi>A good Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A Chriſtian ſouldier muſt have a good Eye; and the goodneſſe of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in theſe two qualities.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is to be a <hi>waking,</hi> or a <hi>Watchful</hi> Eye: a ſouldier that is ſurpriz'd with ſleep, when the enemie is near him, may be knockt in the head before he awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens. Now our enemie is alwayes neer us, and ready at hand, to watch advantages againſt us:
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.8.</note> 
                  <hi>He walks up and down ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> Are we alone? he is buſie to poſſeſſe us with fooliſh and hurtful thoughts; are we in company? he is ready to intangle us in vain and idle
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169709:22"/>words, to make us partakers, or at leaſt countenancers of others in their ſins: are we employed in good actions, as in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or giving alms? he is at hand, if he cannot hinder us from them, to make them ſo performed by us, as they may be unacceptable with God, and ſo unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to us; by putting into us wandring thoughts, and making us aim at vain glory.</p>
               <p>Therefore we can be no longer ſafe from his aſſaults, then we continue watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Its that leſſon which our Saviour hath commanded to all,
<note place="margin">Mar. 13.37</note> 
                  <hi>I ſay watch:</hi> our mindes are ſtill to be intent for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin, or the occaſions of it: this only can make us ſecure. To be confident we ſhall hold out, or be able to withſtand the oppoſition of this great adverſary, without this watchfulneſs, its all one as if a ſouldier ſhould ſhut his eyes, when he is in conflict: whereby it is certain, that as he cannot ſee the danger he is in, ſo neither can he uſe that means, that is otherwiſe in his power, for preventing his being ſurpriz'd with it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A <hi>clear</hi> or <hi>piercing</hi> and <hi>diſcerning</hi> Eye, that is, that we be able to ſee the things without us (which the devil uſes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169709:22"/>to employ againſt us) in their true nature, ſo as to ſee through thoſe falſe gloſses whereby he repreſents them to us. Now the things he thus repreſents, are the pleaſures and profits of the World: the former he repreſents to us as he did the forbidden fruit to <hi>Eve,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.6.</note> as <hi>things pleaſing to the eyes,</hi> ſuch as have a great deal of preſent delight in the uſe of them; in the mean time labouring to hide, as he did from her, the following bitterneſs; the <hi>remorſe of conſcience,</hi> the <hi>griving the ſpirit of God,</hi> the <hi>expoſing our ſelves to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his wrath,</hi> which all inordinate and unlawfull pleaſures are neceſsarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with. The latter he ſets forth as things of high eſteem in the world, and ſuch as will make us live in credit with men; ſuch as will give us much comfort in the enjoyment, and ſecure us from thoſe reproaches and difficulties that men without them are ordinarily expoſed to: but here again, he labours to keep from our notice and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>thorny cares</hi> that attend them, the <hi>inability</hi> that is in them to give us any comfort, when we have moſt need of it; the <hi>certainty</hi> of leaving them, and that (it may be) at ſuch a time when we
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169709:23"/>leaſt think of it, and our hearts are moſt ſet upon them; and eſpecially, the <hi>danger</hi> that is in them of depriving us of the <hi>kingdom of heaven,</hi> if either they be by any unjuſt means attain'd, or our care in getting &amp; keeping of them make us neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect (as eaſily they may, and ordinarily they do) the <hi>things of the kingdom of Heaven, and the righteouſneſſe thereof.</hi> Here then, I ſay, there is need of a pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Eye in the Chriſtian ſouldier,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.22 Matt. 13.22.</note> to ſee the <hi>deceitfulneſſe of theſe pleaſures,</hi> and the <hi>deceitfulneſſe of theſe riches</hi> (for ſuch deceitfulneſs is aſcrib'd to both) to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and conſider in an even ballance, together with the preſent appearing commodities and advantages, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing evils, that is, the dangers and diſadvantages that attend both: which if we truly do, we will certainly ſee no cauſe, whatever luſtre the devil preſents them in, to dote or ſet our hearts ſo far upon them, as to think them worthy the leaſt ſin, to purchaſe or enjoy them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing required in the time of fighting is a <hi>good heart.</hi> A ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that deſires to approve himſelf, will not ſhrink back at the appearance or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of danger; not be appaled to ſee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169709:23"/>another bleed, or die before him; thoſe that ſhould do ſo, will never bring cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to themſelves, nor any real advantage to that cauſe or party they ſerve.</p>
               <p>Now this courage is eſpecially here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: they muſt be no faint, or ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted perſons, that will reſolve to maintain war againſt the devil, againſt ſo cruel an adverſary: He will be ſure to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the raiſing of Storms; to preſent bonds, or poverty, or death before thine eyes, if he ſee thee bent to go on: and though by Gods over-ruling power (who has him ſtill in his chain) he may be reſtrained from actually bringing any of theſe upon thee, yet thou canſt be no longer fafe, then thou art prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, with courage and reſolution to go on, notwithſtanding all theſe.
<note place="margin">Revel. 21.8</note> 
                  <hi>The fearful</hi> are all excluded from having any part in that inheritance that we all deſire, and the devil labours to deprive us of: and our Saviour expreſly requires in this caſe, that we <hi>hate our own lives,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 14.26. John 12.25.</note> and tell us, that by <hi>ſeeking to ſave our life, we ſhall loſe it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 2.4.</note> Now this ('tis true) is no eaſie matter for fleſh and blood: <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life;</hi> ſuch courage is not a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169709:24"/>thing that growes naturally in us: we are all, of our ſelves, like the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> when yet they had not received that power from on high, and therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook their Maſter, and fled from him; yea, we are apt with <hi>Peter</hi> to ſeek ſome baſe unworthy ſhift to ſave our ſelves, when ſuch dangers threaten us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have need of all the helps that may be, for ſtrengthing our ſelves, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us up to this temper and reſolution: and ſuch certainly there are that will be effectual for this end.</p>
               <p>For the fuller manifeſtation of this, I ſhall ſhew theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is more particularly to be meant by this <hi>good heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That as others heretofore have had it, ſo there is a poſſibility and grounds for us ſtill to expect it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What particular means are requir'd for obtaining it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Touching the firſt, we are to take notice, that it is not that which dwells naturally in any man, but that which is ſupernatural, and derived from God: that is, a <hi>divine power</hi> elevating a man (as it were) above himſelf, whereby he is enabled with ſtrength and courage actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169709:24"/>to perform and undergo ſuch things, as cannot be done with meer humane ſtrength; namely, to perſiſt in the way of godlineſſe, and obedience to God; notwithſtanding all the difficulties and diſcouragements that the devil or the world ſhall caſt into it, as extraordinary vexations, and reproaches, and loſſe of goods, or liberty, or life it ſelf.</p>
               <p>This then which enables a man to this, is not any thing in Nature; this will be ſtill favourable to it ſelf, and not willing to venture on thoſe things which are contrary to it, and tend to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it: it is onely that which is called <hi>the finger of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 11.20 24.49. Col. 1.11.</note> or <hi>power from on high,</hi> or <hi>the might of his glorious power;</hi> in brief, it is onely the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> that is, <hi>a divine power ſtampt or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the heart of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Now for the ſecond, that there is truely ſuch a power derivable to men, may appear hence: namely, from the many ſeveral experiments,
<note place="margin">Acts 4.31.5.41.16.24</note> that the world has had in this kinde, eſpecially from the examples of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and others in the primitive times.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> we finde, at firſt, while <hi>Chriſt</hi> was here on earth, very fearful up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:169709:25"/>on the appearance of danger: <hi>Peter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and forſwore his Maſter, and they all forſook him and fled; but immediately after they had received this power from on high, they <hi>ſpake the word withall bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> being <hi>beaten, they went away re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 4.29. Acts 5.41.16.25.</note> being in <hi>the ſtocks, they ſang praiſes;</hi> being encompaſſed with infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and reproaches, and perſecutions, they <hi>took pleaſure in them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.10 Phil. 4.13.</note> and could do <hi>all things through Chriſt ſtrengthning them,</hi> that is, <hi>by his Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus we finde, that not only they, but perſons alſo of inferiour quality and condition, did in effect the ſame things: the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> ſuffered the like things,
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.14</note> of their own Countrey-men, as the Churches of <hi>Judea</hi> did of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which ſure were many bitter troubles and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches: and yet they went on with that undauntedneſs in the practiſe of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.4.</note> that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſayes, <hi>we our ſelves glory in you, in the Churches of God, for your patience and faith in the tribulations and perſecutions that you endure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to both theſe may be added the teſtimonies which the Church-Records afford, both concerning theſe, and other Chriſtians immediately ſucceeding, about
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169709:25"/>their forwardneſſe in moſt cheerfully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing moſt bitter and cruel deaths for the profeſſion of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But it may perhaps be imagined, that this courage and heart they had, was of the ſame nature with thoſe other things, that were miraculous, &amp; peculiar to thoſe times, as <hi>miracles, tongues, prophecies,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore not now to be expected.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to which, I ſhall ſhew you, that this is not ſo, but that there may be ſtill from the goodneſſe of God expected the ſame Divine Spirit, to carry men through all difficulties with ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of cheerfulnes, in the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral reaſons to prove this, 1. Some general promiſes of this Spirit, conſidered with the grounds and reaſons of them: as</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. from verſe the fifth to verſe the thirteenth, where it is ſaid, <hi>If you being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father, give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> 2. The reaſon whereby our <hi>Saviour</hi> here demonſtrates, that God will give the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> to them that ask him, is no other but this, conſtant and importunate prayers, put up by ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169709:26"/>unto God, as becauſe of their faith and unfeigned ſtudy of piety, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his children: w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſure agrees no leſs to theſe, then to the primitive times.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt ſayes, ſimply and indiſtinctly, <hi>He that believes in me, as the Scripture ſaith, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water,
<note place="margin">John 7.37.</note> John</hi> 7.37. which in the following verſe is expounded of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> where it is plain, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to believers, and that as a reward of their faith, the gift of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and therefore ſure upon this ground it may be ſtill ſued for, and expected by thoſe that are truly ſuch, as well in theſe as in former times.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt promiſeth to them that <hi>love him,</hi> that is, <hi>that keep his words,</hi> (for ſo he himſelf there expoundeth this love) <hi>to manifeſt himſelf unto them,
<note place="margin">John 14.21.</note> John</hi> 14.21. and afterward V. 23. that <hi>the Father will love them,</hi> and both <hi>He and the Father will come, and make their abode with them,</hi> that is, by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> for that is the thing there treated on.</p>
               <p>Seeing then, that men in theſe times are capable of loving of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of rendring obedience to his words, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they are expreſly obliged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169709:26"/>it appears hence, that the <hi>holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> which is promiſed by way of reward to ſuch perſons, may be expected by thoſe that are ſuch alſo in theſe times.</p>
               <p>And to theſe teſtimonies may be added that oppoſition, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is made &amp; recorded by all the Evangeliſts, betwixt <hi>Johns bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing with water,</hi> and <hi>Chriſts baptizing with the Spirit:</hi> whence it may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that as <hi>John</hi> did dip with water all his diſciples that came to him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be baptized of him, ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth endue with the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, deſiring to be baptized of him, and by ardent and inceſſant prayers begging ſo excellent a gift from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It hath been ſtill uſuall with all Chriſtians, both in their publike and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate devotions to pray for the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> that God would give it to them: which ſure, if it had been a gift peculiar to the firſt times, like as thoſe other of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that are now ceaſed, all Chriſtians ſince, even the moſt godly, that have been, might be accuſed of great errour and ignorance, in asking that of God which they had no grounds to expect: like as if one ſhould now petition him, to give him the power of doing miracles, or ſpeaking with tongues.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:169709:27"/>3. The principal end for which the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> was given heretofore to men in the primitive times, and the cauſe why it was given for that end, hath place ſtill in theſe times: namely, that men to whom it was given, might aſſuredly come to the <hi>ſalvation</hi> promiſed in the Goſpel, by being <hi>fully confirmed in the belief of it, and going on unweariedly in the way that leads to it:</hi> We had need now, in reference to theſe ends, to have our mindes illuſtrated or inlightned, even after we have heard and received the word of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no leſſe then they who heretofore had entertained the belief of it,
<note place="margin">Eph. 1.17, 18</note> and yet ſtill needed the <hi>ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation,</hi> that they might clearly diſcern the myſteries of Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we have need ſtill of <hi>prudence</hi> in managing our actions, eſpecially ſuch as are very doubtful and difficult; we have need of <hi>fortitude</hi> in dangers, <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> in afflictions, <hi>joy</hi> in outward mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and calamities, and <hi>fervour</hi> in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; all which are immediate effects of the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> not only conducing, but alſo neceſſary for that great end, the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our ſouls. And therefore the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> which can only produce them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169709:27"/>in us, may be ſtill from the wiſdom and goodneſſe of God aſſuredly expected.</p>
               <p>There was, it is true, a promiſe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly an exhibition of the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> that was peculiar to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, betwixt which, and that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to theſe times, we are to conceive theſe differences:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>former</hi> was uſually for the manner and manifeſtation of it viſible and conſpicuous, ſo that the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, being wholly miraculous, might be clearly diſcern'd, and acknowledged by others for ſuch; but this <hi>latter</hi> is inviſible, exerciſing its vertue upon the mindes of thoſe that are poſſeſt with it ſo as others cannot certainly, or ordinarily diſcern it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>former</hi> was not ſo much for the particular good of the perſons, upon whom it was conferred, as for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like benefit of others, and the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the doctrine of the Goſpel, whilſt it was yet new in the world, but this latter is for the ſingular benefit of the perſons themſelves, upon whom it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, as namely for ſupplying them with courage under perſecution, joy in afflictions, and the like, as hath been ſhewed before; things which will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169709:28"/>neceſſary to bring men unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore that, without which they cannot be had, namely the <hi>holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> may ſtill upon the forementioned grounds be certainly expected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now touching the third thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, namely, what are the means requir'd for gaining this <hi>holy Sprit,</hi> or, as we have formerly expreſt it, that <hi>good heart</hi> which is requiſite in the Chriſtian ſouldier, though it ſufficiently appear from what hath been ſaid, that it is derived from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and ſo that there is nothing in us to produce it in our ſelves, yet it hath been alſo intimated, that it uſes not to be conferred at random and promiſcuouſly, there is ſomething on our part required to make us capable of receiving it; as</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is requiſite that we ask it, and that not ſeldom or ſuperficially, but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and importunately, after the example of the importunate widow, or of him that at midnight went to ſolicite his friend, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.6. by both which parables our <hi>Saviour</hi> would intimate to us, that we are to be earneſt and inceſſant in our prayers for this divine gift; that we are not to lay aſide our care, or give over our ſeeking in this kinde, if we meet not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169709:28"/>preſently with an anſwerable return; God doth in the granting of this, as of other inferiour bleſſings, ſeem and ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as if he heard not, as if he were one that took no notice of our requeſts, and that on purpoſe to make us call loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to expreſs more fervency and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: and therefore we are to ſee that our prayers be thus qualified; that they be not faint deſires, or the labour of the lips, but ſtrong and deep cries of the heart, and being ſo, we may and ought with confidence ſupport our ſelves, that in the end we ſhall obtain what we thus deſire; conſidering what our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath told us, that God will give to them that ask him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then we muſt ſee alſo that we be ſuch perſons as the <hi>holy ſpirit</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to, and have grounds to expect upon this importunity the grant of their requeſts.</p>
               <p>All whoſoever ſhall ask, and ask im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately, have not this promiſe made to them. God tells us of ſome,
<note place="margin">Prov. 1.28. Iſaiah 1.15.</note> that ſhould <hi>ſeek him early and ſhould not finde him;</hi> and of others, that though they make <hi>many prayers,</hi> and <hi>ſtretch forth their hands,</hi> and <hi>cry with a loud voice,</hi> that is, very
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169709:29"/>earneſtly and importunately, yet he will not hear them.</p>
               <p>This promiſe is made only by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (as hath been ſhown before) to thoſe that <hi>believe,</hi> to ſuch as <hi>love him and keep his Commandments:</hi> and hereupon S. <hi>James</hi> tells us, that it is not only fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer,
<note place="margin">Jam. 5.16.</note> but the <hi>fervent prayer of a righteous man that availeth much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt then ſee that we be ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſuch <hi>believers,</hi> and <hi>lovers of Chriſt and righteous ones,</hi> or elſe God will ſay, what haſt thou to do to make any ſuch requeſt, to expect any ſuch divine and glorious gift to be conferred on thee?</p>
               <p>Yea indeed, ſo long as any ſin, or the love of any unrighteouſneſſe is lodged in thy ſoul; thou art not only unworthy, but uncapable of ſo divine a gueſt: <hi>The world</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt;</hi> wherby he there more eſpecially means thoſe that refuſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him upon the hearing of his words, and beholding of his actions) <hi>cannot receive the ſpirit of truth,
<note place="margin">John 14.17</note> becauſe it ſeeth him not,</hi> nor knoweth him; that is, though the H. Spirit did clearly ſhine and manifeſt it ſelf in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine words, and admirable works which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169709:29"/>he wrought, yet the world was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſee and take notice of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made it ſelf incapable of receiving the Spirit: whereas the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> &amp; ſome others not ſhutting their eyes againſt it, but willingly diſcerning and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the manifeſtations thereof in him, became ſubjects truly capable of it, and accordingly had it there promiſed, that it ſhould be in them. <hi>John</hi> 14.17. men do not uſe to pour ſome pretious and coſtly liquour into an unclean and filthy veſſel, much leſſe can it become the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wiſdom of Almighty God, ſo to do, to pour this <hi>ſpirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſay 61.3. Acts 10.38.</note> which is called the <hi>oyl of gladneſſe,</hi> having in it a ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening and exhilarating faculty to carry on thoſe with pleaſure through the midſt of dangers and difficulties, that enjoy it; to pour it (I ſay) into their hearts that have the filthineſſe of ſome ſin or other ſtill lodging in them.</p>
               <p>No; thou muſt ſweep diligently all the corners of thy ſoul, cleanſing thy ſelf <hi>from all filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou canſt be a fit temple or habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for this pure and divine ſpirit to come into; the perſons to whom it was formerly given, were ſuch as <hi>obeyed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169709:30"/>God, Acts</hi> 5.32. and the perſons to whom we finde it is promiſed by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> are ſuch as <hi>love and keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> keep them conſtantly and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, not wittingly allowing themſelves in the breach of one, ſo that by reaſon of ſuch keeping, they may be called righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, that is, ſuch as make works of righteouſneſſe their trade and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; giving up or dedicating their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.13.</note> 
                  <hi>as weapons of righteouſneſſe unto God.</hi> Such, perſons as are thus qualified, attain (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks in another caſe) <hi>a good degree and much boldneſſe in the faith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.13</note> a good conſcience, which is the inſeparable attendant of ſuch righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous walking, being of that vertue in it ſelf, as to carry on a man with courage through many matters, in which others are often caſt down with fears, and hence <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes,
<note place="margin">Prov. 28.1.</note> 
                  <hi>the righteous is bold as a lion:</hi> but how much more muſt the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſuch perſons be, when beſides this teſtimonie of their own hearts (for the conſcience is nothing elſe but that) there is added, as a reward thereof, and of their prayers in ſeeking it, this <hi>mighty power from on high;</hi> this divine vertue derived immediately from God, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169709:30"/>ſtampt by his finger in the hearts of ſuch?</p>
               <p>But it may be objected: if we may not expect this <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, before we thus keep his commandments, what hopes can we have then, that we ſhall ever enjoy it? ſeeing that without the aſſiſtance of this <hi>Spirit,</hi> we cannot at all keep the commandments of God in that manner: and beſides, if we may keep and do thoſe things which God requires of us, before the coming of this <hi>ſpirit,</hi> what need will there be of his coming at all, or what cauſe can we have to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it?</p>
               <p>In anſwer to which I ſay there are two ſorts of keeping the Commandments of God:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>More imperfect,</hi> when the fleſh is not throughly brought into ſubjection to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> but the way of holineſs even in the ordinary practiſes of it, as praying, meditating, repreſſing of anger, and the like, is in ſome manner ſtill unpleaſing and difficult to men, though theſe things be ordinarily performed by them; in which ſtate ſo long as a man is, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected that he ſhould fully go through all difficulties, that in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of this warfare he is liable unto.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:169709:31"/>2. There is a <hi>more perfect keeping</hi> of them, when a man does not only ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily and conſtantly obſerve them, but does this with a kinde of pleaſure and delight: the fleſh, that is, the remainder of ſenſual affections which formerly made them ſomewhat harſh, and unpleaſing, being after a manner fully mortified, and extinguiſhed in him; ſo that he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly enabled to overcome all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>Now according to theſe two different degrees of keeping the Commandments of God, there is anſwerably to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a different diſpenſation of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of God, or of the aſſiſtance of it, as the cauſe of either.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A general and more common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary aſſiſtance,</hi> ſuch as uſually goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the word, and is offered and obvious to all, that are not remiſſe and careleſs, but diligent and attentive hearers of it; and this is that which is ſufficient to work that weaker temper of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, before mentioned, in all that do not willfully oppoſe themſelves againſt it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A more ſpeciall and extraordinary aſſiſtance, which is promiſed as a reward
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169709:31"/>of this obedience, whereby a man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to do and undergo greater matters, then that ordinary aſſiſtance could enable him unto; and this is that which is here to be meant, being not to be expected (as not being promiſed to any others) but of ſuch righteous perſons, as we have formerly ſpoke of. They only that uſe that former <hi>talent</hi> well, ſo as to gain out of it, that ſtock of righteouſneſſe, which thereby they are enabled unto, are the perſons which may expect, and are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be truſted with this great <hi>talent,</hi> which will truly make them rich, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in all good works.</p>
               <p>Ye then, whoſe hearts are truly ſet to ſerve God; who ſincerely deſire and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſtruggle with your ſelves to do his will in all things that are made known to you, but yet ſtill finde failings in your ſelves, and ſome tediouſneſſe, and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs in the doing thoſe good things you perform, ſo that ye may perhaps hereupon think your ſelves utterly unable (if you ſhould be put to it) to go through with thoſe greater hardneſſes, of loſſe of goods, liberty, life, &amp;c. which you hear is required to come to the kingdom of God.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:169709:32"/>
               <p>Let not this diſcourage or amate you, hold faſt that whereunto you have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> that is, perſiſt ſtill in ſuch well-doing, and aſſuredly look <hi>for the ſalvation of God;</hi> continue your care, and give God no reſt, but cry mightily and inceſſantly to him for his <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> this <hi>power from on high.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that which he hath reſerv'd within his own power, to beſtow it only upon thoſe that thus ſeek for it in the way of righteouſneſſe; and this is that which he hath abſolutely bound himſelf, ſooner or later to give to ſuch; and this is that which where it is given, will make the rough, plain, and the hard, eaſie, that is, ſo far change the nature of things, that both the ſenſe of the preſent difficulties thou yet feeleſt, ſhall be taken away, and the terrour of thoſe things which thou mayeſt apprehend as future, ſhall have no force at all upon thee: Let not then the experience thou haſt had hitherto of thy own frailties, either make thee look back, and give over ſtriving; or deſpair in time to attain to a greater perfection: this is that which thy great adverſary, the devil, deſires to work thee to, either to make thee from what thou at preſent
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169709:32"/>feeleſt, to forſake the way of godlineſſe, or ſtand at a ſtay in it.</p>
               <p>Reſt aſſured of this; that God can, and will in time make ſuch things not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſible, but alſo eaſie to thee (if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thou perſiſt in well-doing) as now ſeem unpoſsible, and are uncomfortable perhaps to thee to think of; and for ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee the more in this perſwaſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that as he hath bound himſelf by promiſe, ſo thoſe infirmities that are yet in thee (if thy heart be indeed ſincere, and thou truly laboureſt againſt them) they give him the more occaſion for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting this his power in thee;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.9.</note> 
                  <hi>His ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſſe:</hi> thoſe that are weak have moſt need of this help, and in ſuch the glory of this power, and ſo the goodneſſe and wiſdom of God moſt manifeſtly appears, when by carrying them on through ſuch hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſses, as are moſt troubleſome and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to fleſh and blood; he layes open, as it were, this otherwiſe inviſible vertue of his Almighty power;
<note place="margin">Eſay 52.10</note> He <hi>makes bare his arm</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeaks) to the eyes of men, ſo that it may clearly appear to be done by his ſtrength, and ſo all the praiſe thereof muſt neceſsarily redound
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169709:33"/>to him; and hereupon the <hi>Apoſtle, We have this treaſure in earthen veſſels, that the excellencie of the power may be of God,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.7.</note> and not of us:</hi> The earthlineſs or frailty of our condition, whereby we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally afraid to encounter with any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and miſeries, makes for the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying of this power which helps us in theſe infirmities; and the greater the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties are, and the more unproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to our weakneſs, the more they ſerve to the honour of this power, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently God may be expected to be the more ready at ſuch times for our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
               <p>Having thus far enlarged touching the courage that is required in our <hi>Chriſtian Warfare,</hi> and the means for attaining it: I ſhall yet further in reference unto both, and to make us perſiſt without fainting or declining in the courſe of godlineſs, commend to you three particular rules to be obſerved, as thoſe which may be very ſerviceable and effectuall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>Firſt to look upon ſteddily with the eye of faith, that glorious <hi>prize</hi> for which we fight, which God holds forth in his hands to encourage us; and which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169709:33"/>the devil by all means labours to keep out of our ſight, and deprive us of:</p>
               <p>It is that, then which God hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greater to beſtow, nor we to deſire,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.12. Luke 12.33. 1 Cor. 9.25. 1 Pet. 5.10. Heb. 12.28.</note> a <hi>great reward in Heaven, treaſures that fail not, a rich and glorious inheritance an incorruptible crown, an eternal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that cannot be ſhaken,</hi> in brief, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition full of all good things, which our hearts can poſſibly imagine, or rather which is not poſſible for them to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is moſt certain in it ſelf, confirm'd to us (as the reſt of his doctrine was) by <hi>Chriſts miracles, and blood, and his riſing, and aſcenſion into heaven, and many viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſſions of the holy Spirit thence,</hi> and further in a leſſer degree, by thoſe things which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did and ſuffered, by the ſufferings of many others ſince, even unto our times, and by the preſent and long continued condition of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is aſſured onely to ſuch as go through with this warfare, as not only fight, but fight it out unto the laſt: ſuch <hi>as endure unto the end,</hi> that <hi>are faithfull to the death,</hi> only to ſuch, and to all ſuch, it is unqueſtionably aſſured.</p>
               <p>Thus we are to repreſent this glorious
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169709:34"/>
                  <hi>prize</hi> to our ſelves, thus qualified and limited: which if we do, the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of it ſeriouſly and deliberately in this manner, cannot but derive ſtrength and courage to us: what hardneſſe and hazards will men willingly ingage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in, when the hopes of wearing a crown, or enjoying a kingdom, is the lure to draw them on; though poſsibly they may periſh in the venturing for it, or elſe not long enjoy it when they have gained it? what tedious difficulties, and adventures will others readily imbark themſelves in, when the wealth of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> is looked upon by them, as things by that means to be attained; though poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (as the former) they may miſcarry in the voyage, or not enjoy thoſe things long after their return? yea, what pains will many take, and that in a manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and continually, when that which is far leſs then a kingdom, or ſuch wealth, is all the motive they have, namely ſome encreaſe of their ſtock, or fruitful return of the ground?</p>
               <p>All theſe things (it is plain) have ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in them to ingage men in very hard and difficult matters; And what then? ſhall we not think there is the ſame, or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169709:34"/>far greater vertue in this glorious <hi>prize</hi> to make men contend for it with hazards, difficulties and labour?</p>
               <p>What is the cauſe that men are ſo bent upon theſe things? Is it not becauſe they love them, and eſteem them, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire them, and ſee no other wayes of poſsibly coming to them? Do not thoſe that fight and venture their lives for a Crown, know, that it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch fighting and venturing to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? and do not thoſe that ingage themſelves in ſuch long &amp; hazardous voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to the Indies, know that the riches that are there, are not otherwiſe to be come at? and is not in either of theſe the high opinion and ardent deſire they have of theſe things, joyned with ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, ſufficient to ingage them (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they cannot but know alſo the uncertainty of their ſucceſſe) in ſuch difficult undertakings? yea, do not you husbandmen know that however the ſeaſon falls out, you muſt plow and ſowe, and tend your cattle, or elſe you cannot expect your deſired increaſe? and will any of you then fold your hands in your boſom, when there is ſome more then ordinary trouble to be undergone about
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169709:35"/>theſe things? will you content your ſelves with wiſhing that theſe things may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper? does not the knowledge you have of the neceſsity of your labour herein, and the high account you make of theſe things, make you willingly go through any ſharpneſſe of weather, or whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver other difficulty in this kinde?</p>
               <p>Conſider then (I beſiech you) ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with your ſelves, whether there is not great reaſon to think, that this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reward held forth in the hands of Almighty God, and lookt upon as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it ſelf, and only attainable in the way of perſeverance in well-doing; may not have the ſame courſe effectually to ingage you to go through all difficulties: But you (like as the moſt) are willing to think, that though theſe periſhing good things cannot be got without toil &amp; pains, and hazards; yet this rich and glorious inheritance may be attained without any ſuch trouble, or difficulty; ſome <hi>wiſhes, or purpoſes, or languiſhing ineffectual fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe endeavours;</hi> ſome formall outward heartleſſe devotion one day in the week ſhall be enough to ſecure you of it: But alas (Beloved) do not abuſe your ſelves, or rather do not ſuffer the devil to abuſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169709:35"/>you, by poſſeſsing you with ſuch under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing thoughts of this glorious rich reward; ſuch as are indeed moſt corrupt and groundleſſe, and will prove in the end certainly deſtructive to your ſouls: a ſouldiers life is made up of hardneſſe and danger, and ſo is the <hi>Chriſtian ſouldiers,</hi> though in another kinde: there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant diſcipline to be exerciſed, conſiſting in <hi>praying, and meditating, and exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and watching, and mortifying the fleſh;</hi> which is to be done by abridging your ſelves in many things that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual part inclines you to, though this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridging of your ſelves ſhould be as harſh to you, as the pulling out of an Eye, or cutting off a hand: and there is courage required, not only to make you willing to fight, and encounter with dangers, and difficulties in the practiſe of godlineſſe; but to carry you through them, and make you conquer them; without which, though you make never ſo good Eſſayes and beginnings, yet all will prove fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and in vain: it is not he that begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but that <hi>endures to the end ſhall be ſaved;</hi> yea, not he that fighteth, but that conquereth, is promiſed to be crowned: <hi>to him that overcometh, I will give to eat
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169709:36"/>of the tree of life that is in the midſt of the paradiſe of my God: and he that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 2.7.11.</note> And <hi>he that overcometh and keeps my words to the end,
<note place="margin">Rev. 2.26.3.21.</note> I will give him power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the nations:</hi> and <hi>him that overcometh I will give to ſit on my throne, even as I have overcome, and have ſit down on my Fathers throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it is plain; there muſt be an <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al overcoming</hi> of all hardſhips and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that lie in our way to the crown of life, or elſe we cannot expect it; and in this there is a difference betwixt the <hi>Chriſtian ſouldier,</hi> and other ſouldiers; theſe, though they are bound to fight, yet they are not bound to overcome, becauſe it may be impoſſible for them, though they uſe all poſſible ſtrength and courage; but we are bound to overcome, as well as to fight; and this implies that both theſe are in a manner alike poſſible and certain; the reaſon whereof is this, that ſo long as we fight in this warfare, we have an almighty power aſſiſting us, and backing us out, and carrying us on, ſo that it is impoſſible that any thing ſhould be too ſtrong for us: but this, I ſay, is only <hi>ſo long</hi> as we fight, or are willing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169709:36"/>to do ſo, that we have this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, the <hi>Lord of hoſts</hi> thus ſtrengthning us: He does not dowith his ſouldiers, as ſome <hi>Generals</hi> or <hi>Captains</hi> ſometimes uſe to do with theirs, thruſt them on againſt their wills: no; as he needs not, ſo he ſcorns to have any ſuch ſervice done him, and much more to force any himſelf to do it. Thoſe that are fearful to go on, or willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from this warfare, they muſt not look to be compelled by him; He cares for none but a <hi>willing people,</hi> ſuch as are truly willing and reſolved to uſe that ſtrength they have in this warfare; and ſuch perſons as are thus diſpoſed, may aſſuredly reckon, not only to finde daily more ſtrength, but alſo certainty to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. Look upon thoſe that have gone before us in <hi>this warfare:</hi> what extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and difficulties have many of the moſt eminent ſervants of God been caſt upon, and how cheerfully have they gone through them? ſome have <hi>had
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169709:37"/>tryal of cruel mockings, and ſcourgings, and bonds, and impriſonment; others ſtoned,

               <p>'Tis true, we are not through the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God called to encounter with ſuch hardſhips, as they were put upon, but we know not what we may be, and we can be no longer ſure, nor ſafe, then we
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169709:37"/>are in readineſſe, and ſtill preparing our ſelves for them, that is, <hi>martyres in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratione animi:</hi> and this we are alwayes called unto, to be <hi>dying daily</hi> in our ſelves, to exerciſe a kinde of cruelty (but indeed a mercie to our ſouls) in killing all inordinate luſts; in curbing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting our ſelves in that which the bent of our hearts, and ſtream of this world carry us to; in practiſing the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of godlineſſe commended to us in the word, how much ſoever againſt the hair, or what diſrepute, or diſadvantage ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they draw upon us from the world.</p>
               <p>This was that which theſe forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned worthies were well exerciſed in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to theſe harſher encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and without this, they had never been able to have ſuffered what they did, but the doing of theſe things upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, pulled out the ſting from thoſe evils, that were in the power of others to inflict on them: and thus can we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepare our ſelves for this enduring of the like things which they did; thus on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt our ſelves to have a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, to be members of that body, which they belong to, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſt is the head: we muſt thus far

Look upon the <hi>Captain of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, our Lord Jeſus Christ:</hi> look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him ſo, as not only to behold him, as gone before thee, but as one now that eyes thee from Heaven; that ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to obſerve how thou demeaneſt thy ſelf: it is ſaid, that <hi>Caeſars Eye</hi> made his ſouldiers valiant, and ſo its found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the eye of the General, or ſome great Officer, carries on ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that which otherwiſe of themſelves they would not enterprize: how much more may the Eye of this <hi>General</hi> incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thee, ſeeing it is not onely in his power to reward thee, but even at this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169709:38"/>diſtance, to derive influence into thee? yea, he looks upon thee for this end; and not only ſo, but he purpoſely hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore led that way himſelf, that is, he was <hi>made perfect through ſufferings,</hi> that he might be the more ready to <hi>ſuccour them that ſuffer or are tempted,</hi> having <hi>been in all things tempted as we are,</hi>

               <p>The ſecond is to be concerning the <hi>Weapons</hi> belonging to this Warfare, as they are here generally deſcrib'd.</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>Negatively,</hi> that they <hi>are not carnal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> that they <hi>are mighty through God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Touching the firſt, we are to take notice here, that there are ſeveral ſorts of weapons, which may be called <hi>carnal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as tend directly to the <hi>deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the fleſh,</hi> that is, of theſe carnal bodies whereof we conſiſt; ſuch as are Swords, and Guns, and the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as as are in <hi>the power of the fleſh to uſe,</hi> and ordinarily are made uſe of by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169709:39"/>the wiſdom and direction of the fleſh, though not directly tending to any ſuch deſtructive effects, as the former.</p>
               <p>That the weapons belonging to this <hi>Warfare,</hi> as they were managed by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and other Chriſtians in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, were not <hi>de facto carnal</hi> in the firſt ſenſe is well enough known, and acknowledged generally by all: that it was <hi>de jure,</hi> that they were not ſo, and ſo that they ought ſtill not to be <hi>carnal</hi> in this manner, may appear from theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>condition of the place</hi> we fight for, it is no <hi>carnal paradiſe,</hi> no earthly <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſuch, as others may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate us in the poſſeſſion of, and ſo by violence keep us out; but it is <hi>the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jeruſalem, the citie of the living God;</hi> a place ſufficiently capacious of all that deſire to come to it, and alike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible for any by the immediate or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural force of theſe <hi>carnal weapons</hi> or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to be kept from it, as it is to be gained by the uſe of any ſuch means: yea, the attempting of violence againſt the ſervants of God in this kind, &amp; even the killing of them becauſe they are ſuch, ſends them but the ſooner and ſurer thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169709:40"/>ſufferings and not actions of this nature, being the condition of our future reigning in glory.
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the <hi>nature of the enemies</hi> we fight againſt: they are (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12.) <hi>not fleſh and blood, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers, and the rulers of the darkneſſe of this world,
<note place="margin">Eph. 6.12.</note> and ſpiritual wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes in high places.</hi> What ſhall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Swords or Guns do towards the annoying or repelling ſuch enemies? <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> (all know) are not capable of being hurt or wounded; and theſe are the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (as we are here told) that we have to deal with, ſuch as are wholly <hi>inviſible,</hi> and <hi>immaterial,</hi> and therefore muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly be encountred with weapons and armour ſutable, that is, ſuch as are truly ſpiritual, and are at large ſet down and commended to us in the ſame place, from verſe 13. to 19.</p>
               <p>Tis true; men that conſiſt of fleſh and blood, are often the inſtruments of theſe ſpiritual adverſaries; and that, as by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means, as counſelling, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and the like; ſo by applying theſe carnal deſtructive weapons to batter our faith, and turn us by the force of them out of the way to Heaven; but yet in ſo
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169709:40"/>doing, they are but ſtill the viſible inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe inviſible and principal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, whoſe efficacie therefore in this kinde is not to be repelled by any the like <hi>carnal weapons,</hi> for in doing, or rather attempting to do this, that is, to repreſſe one violence and carnal hoſtility by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, we lay our ſelves more open to theſe grand enemies; yea, we thereby plainly declare, that we have received thoſe wounds, which by this means they labour to inflict on us, namely, <hi>a violating of our faith,</hi> an <hi>extinction,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of that Heroick Charity, and meekneſſe, and patience,</hi> which are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely required in us, and without which we cannot attain the end of our warfare, the ſalvation of our Souls; which points me to the third reaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And it is taken from the Laws, that are preſcribed to be neceſſarily obſerved by us in the managing of our warfare, and as parts of it; all which may be reduced and <hi>epitomiz'd</hi> into that royal one of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> which our great <hi>Agonothetles,</hi> the <hi>Captain General</hi> of our warfare hath at once exemplified in his practiſe, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on us by his doctrine; it is ſuch a charity, as is to be for the object of it,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169709:41"/>
                  <hi>univerſal; Enemies,</hi> who of all men have the leaſt right to it, are to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it, and it is to be for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance and exerciſes of it, <hi>conſtant and unwearied;</hi> ſuch as no injuries muſt be able to change or overcome; if our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be ſuch as ſet upon us with <hi>curſes,</hi> the return we are to make,
<note place="margin">Matth 5.44 Rom. 12.14, 17, 19, 20, 21</note> is <hi>bleſſing of them;</hi> if they be ſuch, as proſecute us with an inward hatred, bearing altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a hoſtile minde againſt us, we are to requite, and ſo labour to overcome them, by <hi>doing them good;</hi> if laſtly they be ſuch as by their actions are truly damageable and hurtful to us, <hi>uſing us deſpitefully,</hi> and <hi>perſecuting of us,</hi> then, though hereby they declare themſelves to be the moſt peſtilent, and worſt ſort of enemies, we are to recompence them with one of the beſt offices which we can poſsibly do for them, and that is, <hi>pray unto God for them,</hi> in whoſe hands are all things, and who can, not only confer on them innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable benefits, which are not in our power, but is alſo able to change their hearts, and to make them of evil become good.</p>
               <p>Theſe are to be the <hi>emanations</hi> of that divine love, which the <hi>Captain of our
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169709:41"/>Faith</hi> hath commended unto all thoſe, that will fight under him, or by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and he hath commended them by ſuch a reaſon, as ſhowes at once, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and neceſſity of them, ſaying, that <hi>you may be the children of your Father which is in Heaven,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.41</note> for he maketh the Sun to ſhine on, &amp;c.</hi> whereby he in effect tells us, that we can only by thus doing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> that is, ſo as men are capable of being his ſons here, in this life, by <hi>imitation and ſimilitude of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> and as it is deſign'd, they ſhall be hereafter his ſons by partaking of <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and his eternal inheritance;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if our love be of a lower pitch, ſo as to love them only that love us, and do good to them of whom we have already received, or hope to receive the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, we are but like other men, or even like <hi>Publicans,</hi> a ſort of ſinfull and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous perſons, who did as much, and therefore are to expect no greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, then they were to receive.</p>
               <p>This then being the diſpoſition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Chriſtian ſouldier</hi> is to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his carnal enemie (againſt whom theſe <hi>carnal weapons</hi> can only be uſeful) that is, with a heart full of love, ſo as to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169709:42"/>it ſelf in the moſt genuine and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table effects of it, as <hi>bleſſing,</hi> and <hi>doing good to,</hi> and <hi>praying for him,</hi> and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when his enmity is at the higheſt pitch, expreſſing it ſelf in deſpiteful uſage and perſecution; what warrant, or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can he have for employing theſe carnal weapons, namely <hi>ſwords and guns,</hi> and other ſuch <hi>mortal inſtruments</hi> to the deſtruction of others? can the imployment of theſe in this way be poſsibly reconciled with the former love, and expreſsions of it, that are ſo indiſpenſably required of us? is there any evidence or effect of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie greater, which it is poſſible for man to execute, then what is hereby acted, namely the killing of mens bodies, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving them of their preſent lives and being.</p>
               <p>Sure we may well think, what ever credit at preſent, the uſe of theſe <hi>weapons</hi> are in, or whatever worldly advantages may be or are ordinarily gain'd by the uſe of them, that it can neither be honorable, nor ſafe for the <hi>Chriſtian ſouldier</hi> that profeſſes to fight under <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and for the <hi>kingdom of Heaven</hi> to make uſe of them in this warfare; ſeeing in ſo doing he muſt needs act againſt that <hi>royal law
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169709:42"/>of Love,</hi> which this our great <hi>Captain</hi> hath impoſed on all his ſouldiers invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably to be obſerved; and conſequently forfeit his hopes and title to that place for which he pretends to fight, as having violated the condition that is neceſſarily required for coming thereunto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now touching the ſecond ſort of <hi>carnal weapons</hi> before mentioned, namely ſuch as are in the power of the fleſh to uſe, and are ordinarily made uſe of by the direction of this part, that is, by the appointment of that <hi>carnal wiſdom</hi> which is in men; we mean hereby more particularly <hi>humane eloquence,

               </p>
               <p>Where, in making this the oppoſite tearm to theſe <hi>carnal</hi> weapons, ſaying, <hi>they are not carnal, but mighty,</hi> he tacitely implies, that all theſe <hi>carnal</hi> weapons are not <hi>mighty,</hi> but <hi>infirm and weak;</hi> &amp; this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may ſeem a <hi>Paradox,</hi> as many other things do, that are affirmed in <hi>the word,</hi> namely, that thoſe things whereby we ſee ſuch great matters daily effected in the world, as the overturning of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, diſpeopling of Countreys, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the laws and government of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, and altering religions and the outward profeſsion of them: ſhould yet be called (and ſo ſurely of right are to be accounted) but weak things: for the conceiving therefore of this aright, we muſt take notice what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here means by this <hi>weakneſſe</hi> (implicitely here aſcribed to them) and that is, not a weakneſſe to deſtroy, but a weakneſſe to ſave; not a weakneſſe to do evil, but to do good; in brief, ſuch a weakneſſe, as implies them unable both to withſtand the force of thoſe mighty weapons the Apoſtle means, and to effect that which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169709:44"/>by the power of theſe hath been, and is ſtill in ſome degree effected in the world.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe weapons are <hi>weak</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the force, &amp;c. when the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and other his fellow-champions in this <hi>Chriſtian warfare,</hi> began to make uſe of theſe weapons he here means, for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to root out all <hi>Paganiſh</hi> ſuperſtition and idolatry out of the world, the world was then full of theſe carnal weapons of both ſorts, and never raged more in the uſe of them, againſt thoſe that uſed theſe other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; on the one hand, fighting againſt them with <hi>bonds, impriſonments, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces,</hi> and many <hi>cruel and ignominious deaths;</hi> on the other hand withſtanding them, and labouring to uphold the credit of their old ſuperſtitions by many <hi>elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and elaborate diſcourſes,</hi> framed by their <hi>Oratours</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded in wit, and learning of all ſorts; yet notwithſtanding all theſe things, thoſe Chriſtian Champions by the alone uſe of theſe other weapons, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had commended to them, went on daily conquering and prevailing; that faith they thus fought for, came in a little
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169709:44"/>time to be extended to, and profeſt in moſt parts of the world, and thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and idolatrous practiſes in religion, that for many ages the world generally had been accuſtomed to, and ſo could not be but in love with, which they fought againſt, came in a ſhort time to vaniſh out of the world, and ſo remain extinct at this day, as if they had never had had any footing in it.</p>
               <p>This ſhews, as the ſtrength of theſe <hi>Chriſtian weapons,</hi> both for propagating the faith, and overthrowing that which was contrary to it: ſo the weakneſſe of the other in both theſe reſpects: that they were neither able to hinder the growth of that faith, they ſo much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, nor preſerve the credit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of thoſe antient ſuperſtitions, they were ſo much employed for.</p>
               <p>Tis true indeed, there are ſince other ſuperſtitions grown up, as namely that of <hi>Mahomet:</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith hath loſt footing in many places, where it once had, but this is not to be imputed either to the power of thoſe <hi>carnal</hi> weapons, or to the weakneſſe of theſe <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ones, as if they were unable to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>erve what once they had gained; but only to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169709:45"/>the neglect and diſuſe of them: men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan before this <hi>apoſtaſie</hi> to lay aſide thoſe <hi>weapons of zeal,</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and <hi>contempt of the world,</hi> by the uſe of which, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves had been ſo victorious, and like the <hi>men of this world,</hi> imployed their thoughts and ſet their mindes upon the things of it; eagerly conteſting about them, and willingly uſing what ſtrength it could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford (though apparently inconſiſtent with theſe weapons) for ſecuring to them the enjoyment of the ſaid worldly things, and ſo plainly thereby expreſſed a greater zeal for this world, then for the next; and ſo long as it was ſo, what marvel, if this alteration follow? ſeeing things are to be preſerved by the ſame means, by which they are at firſt gott: ſo that (I ſay) it is plain; it was not through the ſtrength of theſe other car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weapons, or weakneſſe of thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ones, but meerly through the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe of the latter, that thoſe things have ſo come to paſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>weakneſſe</hi> of thoſe appears in this, that they are utterly unable to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that which by theſe hath been, and is ſtill in part effected in the world, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169709:45"/>to <hi>plant or preſerve religion in mens hearts:</hi> and this the very name that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them implies, namely that they are called <hi>carnal: Religion</hi> is in its nature a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> thing nothing elſe in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>but a voluntary unconſtrain'd dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoul and affections to God, and an anſwerable outward worſhip and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of him proceeding thence;</hi> for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting and guiding of both which, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt of neceſſity be originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from God, who is a <hi>Spirit</hi> himſelf, and can only ſhow us the way of his own worſhip. Now all theſe forementioned weapons being <hi>carnal,</hi> it muſt needs be beyond their power to work or produce ſuch a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> thing, as <hi>religion</hi> is; that <hi>which is of the fleſh, is fleſh;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John. 3.6.</note> nothing can act beyond its own <hi>Sphear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. All thoſe diſcourſes which <hi>Orators</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have uſed, or which are in the power of men, by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to continue, are but reſults of <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> bare humane diſcoveries, which therefore muſt be held ineffectual, either to ſhew us perfectly how and wherein God is to be worſhipped, or to make that impreſſion upon our ſpirits, as to confirm or quicken us in his ſervice.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:169709:46"/>2. Thoſe other ſort of carnal weapons are farre more improper for this end; namely, to make uſe of worldly terrours, as <hi>Bonds, impriſonments,</hi> and <hi>confiſcation of goods,</hi> for planting or preſerving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in men: for this very way of planting or preſerving it, is that which directly overthrowes it, and makes that which is ſo planted none at all; <hi>Religion being a voluntary thing, a free offering and dedicating a mans ſelf to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tis true indeed, this way of planting and maintaining Religion, is and hath been much uſed in the world, and may ſeem to have been very prevalent, and powerful in reſpect of thoſe great, and numerous multitudes that are profeſſours of ſuch religions: as among the <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> where a man is not ſuffered to profeſſe any other manner of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then what the <hi>Pope</hi> profeſſes and allows without the hazard of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, or life. But as it is certain, that ſuch planting or preſerving of religion, hath nothing to ſupport it from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or examples of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> ſo is it no leſſe certain, that ſuch way of planting (what ever ſhew
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169709:46"/>it makes) is altogether ineffectual for ſuch ends: its true, it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged there are many great and numerous multitudes in thoſe places, which by means of thoſe <hi>carnal weapons</hi> chiefly, are kept in the profeſſion of the outward form, and worſhip of God, which is there profeſſed and maintained; but their doing thus, is not properly to be called, nor accounted <hi>Religion,</hi> that being (as I have already ſaid) a <hi>voluntary thing,</hi> and ſo far only to be accounted <hi>Religion,</hi> as it is ſo. Whoſoever profeſſing any Religion, true, or falſe, out of fear, ſo as thereby to avoid thoſe loſſes and hazards which are threatned to the <hi>non-profeſſors,</hi> that perſon by ſuch a profeſſion is to be accounted to act rather a matter of policy, then of religion to take care rather for providing for his outward tranquillity and profits in this world, then for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace of conſcience, and ſalvation in the next.</p>
               <p>Indeed the doctrine or religion of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> as it is for ſo much of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it differs from ours, and which makes it <hi>Popery,</hi> to be accounted no other, but the doctrine and traditions, or inventions of men, ſuch as have no foundation at
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169709:47"/>all in the <hi>word of God;</hi> ſo the means which are taken by them for preſerving the credit and profeſsion thereof with men, as penalties, and impriſonments, &amp;c. are to be eſteemed no other, but dictates of <hi>carnal wiſdom,</hi> or <hi>worldly policie;</hi> the ends whereof are, not to provide for mens ſpiritual intereſts, or the ſalvation of their ſouls, but only for their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quietneſſe and advantage, and ſome other things eſpecially belonging to their bodies: it being not poſsible that true <hi>Religion</hi> (which is a voluntary thing) ſhould be planted in mens mindes by any worldly force or fears; nor conſequently that the good of mens ſouls, which wholly depends thereon, ſhould be any thing advanced by any ſuch means as are made uſe of in that way; ſo as either to begin, or preſerve in men ſuch a profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>
               <p>This then ſhews, partly the <hi>folly,</hi> and partly the <hi>crueltie</hi> of all ſuch <hi>Polititians,</hi> for ſo they account themſelves, and there are many ſuch in the world, others as well as <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that make uſe of theſe weapons of worldly terrours, or penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in caſe of <hi>Religion;</hi> ſo as thereby to ingage men in ſuch, or ſuch a profeſsion,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169709:47"/>or in holding ſuch opinions as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves approve of: for the religion or opinion that is by this means attempted to be perſwaded on others, muſt be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily either true or falſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>opinion</hi> be indeed true, which is thus attempted to be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon others; the party on whom this attempt is made muſt be ſuppoſed hereupon, either <hi>to embrace it,</hi> or ſtill not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe penalties that are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>to ſtand out and oppoſe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the former be ſuppoſed, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering thoſe means can have no force at all to convince his judgement, or better his underſtanding, it muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that his embracing ſuch a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or opinion, hereupon is only an act of carnal fear, making him to profeſſe that as true, which though true in it ſelf, is falſe in his judgement and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ſo ſuch a profeſsing, though it be of the truth, is a doing of a thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his conſcience, and ſo an act of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and conſequently that, which inſtead of bringing him nearer unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (which is the onely end of all true religion and profeſsion of it) ſets him further off the way to Hell, a place
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169709:48"/>peculiarly deſigned amongſt others, for <hi>all hypocrites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the latter be ſuppoſed,
<note place="margin">Mtatt. 24.51</note> namely, that the party ſtill, notwithſtanding ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, ſtands out and oppoſes; then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the inclination that is in men to think well of that cauſe, for which they ſee others willingly to ſuffer hardſhip, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then deſert the profeſsion of it; there will be probably hereby begot in mens mindes, eſpecially thoſe that are religiouſly diſpoſed, (proportionable to their ſufferings) a better opinion of that, though falſe, which they ſee ſo maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo conſequently a weaker affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the truth which will thereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be ſo zealouſly oppoſed: For we are to conceive a great deal of difference betwixt mens ſufferings in this kinde, and the ſufferings of thoſe that are puniſht for murder or theft, &amp;c. Theſe latter, are clearly things evil in themſelves, and ſo accounted and condemned by the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of thoſe that ſuffer for them: and therefore, though ſome may be inclined to pitty the perſons ſuffering, eſpecially if their ſufferings be extream, yet none will be hereby inclined to think the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of theſe things, or think theſe perſons
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169709:48"/>examples imitable; but in matters of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> or <hi>opinions</hi> about Religion, it is not ſo, that which is true, and ſeems true to one, may ſeem falſe to another, and while it ſo ſeems, the perſon that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers for oppoſing it, or for denying to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, does not that which his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence condemns him for, neither gives others juſt cauſe to think ſo of him, but contrarily ſuffers for that, which in the judgement of his own conſcience is good and right, chooſing rather to do ſo, then offend his conſcience.</p>
               <p>Now whiles he does ſo, and gives o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers occaſion to think ſo of him, there is danger rather, that that for which he ſo ſuffers, though falſe in it ſelf, ſhould gain credit hereby with others, then that truth which he thus oppoſes ſhould by this means any thing be advantaged. So true is that of <hi>Tertullian,
<note place="margin">In Apolog.</note> Exquiſitior quaeque crudelitas, illecebra magis eſt ſectae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly if the truth which this perſon oppoſes, be a great fundamental truth, ſuch as the denying or oppoſing of it excludes a man from ſalvation; and if (as in ſome places it is uſed) he ſhall have therefore the extremeſt that he can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169709:49"/>inflicted upon him, namely ſome violent death, which rather then he will conſent to the profeſsion of, he willingly undergoes; will not the inflicting of death in this caſe (when there is no other cauſe of it) be extream cruelty? can there be any thing more againſt <hi>Chriſtian Charity,</hi> then to deſtroy (as much as is in man) a mans body and ſoul at once? and is not this to do ſo, to take away a mans life from him, for holding ſuch an errour, or opinion in <hi>Religion,</hi> with which (it is believed) a man cannot be ſaved? does not charity, and reaſon it ſelf direct us, that in this caſe, we ſhould uſe <hi>prayers,</hi> and <hi>arguments,</hi> and <hi>perſwaſions,</hi> and if all theſe prove ineffectual, yet ſince God hath limited no time, wherein they ſhould take effect, to leave the perſon to Gods tribunal, rather then to inflict any ſuch judgement upon him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the religion or opinion which a man is perſwaded to by the force of theſe worldly penalties be falſe, then likewiſe we are here to ſuppoſe that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, either he doth imbrace it, or (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſaid penalties) ſtill ſtand out, and deny his conſent: if the former be ſuppoſed, then the perſons that do
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169709:49"/>ſo, hereby are doubly the <hi>Children of Hell;</hi> as both profeſsing a <hi>Religion</hi> falſe in it ſelf, and doing it againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; and ſo their condemnation muſt needs be the heavier: if the latter be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, then they that ſo ſtand out, ſhew themſelves to be truly vertuous and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and what thing can be more unjuſt, then to afflict and perſecute ſuch perſons; to puniſh men becauſe they will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe or believe that, which they are bound not to do, namely, that which is falſe?</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee every way the unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe and injuſtice of uſing carnall weapons in matters of <hi>Religion;</hi> how not only ineffectual they are, for planting any <hi>Religion</hi> at all (truly and properly ſo called) in mens mindes, but alſo, how the uſing of them plainly manifeſts the folly and cruelty of all ſuch <hi>Polititians,</hi> as do ſo: their folly uſing that which is no way proper for the end, for which they pretend to uſe it; and their cruelty in doing that, which either tends to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men in the broad way to Hell, or to moleſt and diſquiet them, becauſe they will not turn out of the right and <hi>narrow way</hi> which only leads to Heaven.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:169709:50"/>
               <p>Thus far touching the weakneſſe of carnal weapons in matters of <hi>Religion:</hi> I am now to ſpeak of the mightineſſe of theſe other weapons the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here means; though ſomething hath already been by the way ſhown concerning this: but now I ſhall more expreſly treat here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and therefore declare (which I have not yet done) what we are to underſtand by theſe weapons; touching this then we are to conceive, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> may have a double reference or meaning.</p>
               <p n="1">1. So as to underſtand ſome weapons that were peculiar to himſelf, and the other <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſome extraordinary perſons, and ſo limited to that time they lived in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So as to underſtand ſuch as were common to him and them with us, and ſo which are to be extended to all times.</p>
               <p>The former were of two ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reſpecting thoſe within the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Reſpecting Thoſe without.</p>
               <p>By the former I mean that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had of inflicting ſome divine remarkable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, on ſuch perſons as were very contumacious, or ſcandalous profeſſours
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169709:50"/>of <hi>the truth,</hi> which power, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> particularly had, there are many paſſages to prove in theſe two Epiſtles to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> as,
<note place="margin">1 Co. 4.21.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall I come unto you with rod, or in love, and in the ſpirit of meckneſſe?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. compared with the three verſes immediately going before; and in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. <hi>having in readineſſe to revenge all diſobedience:</hi> and verſe 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>though I ſhould boaſt ſomewhat of our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your deſtruction,</hi> and after at the 13. Chapter and ſecond Verſe, <hi>If I come again, I will not ſpare;</hi> and verſe 10. <hi>I write theſe things being abſent, leſt being preſent I ſhould uſe ſharpneſſe according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to this kinde of puniſhment, that <hi>delivering unto Satan,</hi> which we read of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. rightly belongs, concerning which we are to conceive, that the perſons who were thus <hi>delivered up,</hi> were after a manner put into the hands and power of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to be vexed and moleſted by him, in ſuch a ſort, as was limited by <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> himſelf; namely
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169709:51"/>for this end, <hi>for the deſtruction of the fleſh, and that their ſpirits might be ſaved in the day of the Lord,</hi> that is, that the devil might afflict the fleſh of ſuch a perſon, and by little and little bring him near to death, and yet in the mean time, leave him ſome ſpace of repentance, and of praying and ſeeking unto <hi>God;</hi> for though <hi>Satan</hi> greedily gape after mans deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet there may be ſome limits ſet him by God in afflicting one given into his power, which he ſhall not have ability to exceed; as we finde, God firſt permitted to <hi>Satan</hi> all things belonging to <hi>Job,</hi> but ſo that he ſhould not touch his body, and afterwards he permitted him his body too, but with exception of his life, that he ſhould not take that away: and the uſe we are to conceive, that this power, and ſort of puniſhing, (as it was mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the hands of the Apoſtle) ſerved for, was at once to aſſert his authority, and conſequently the credit and importance of what he taught; and alſo to ſubdue ſuch contumacious and ſcandalous perſons as it was exerciſed upon, from ſuch their wickedneſſe. Now concerning this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of delivering unto <hi>Satan;</hi> it will be fit to obſerve theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:169709:51"/>1. That as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had the power of inflicting this puniſhment, ſo he had no doubt alſo the power of removing it; yea, we are to think much rather, that he had this, in as much as the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> inclines rather to acts of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then of ſeverity, and to ſave rather then to deſtroy: therefore we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that if any thus puniſhed did ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably repent, he might through the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> prayers be freed from that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and healed; ſeeing the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> alſo had <hi>power over evil ſpirits,</hi> and <hi>the gifts of healing,</hi> whereupon many ſeem to be of opinion, that the <hi>inceſtuous perſon</hi> ſpoke of in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. had this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pardoned to him, and that thoſe words 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5. belong to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is credible, that this power was common then to very few with the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> and perhaps not to any, beſides the other <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>l into the ſea upon <hi>Chriſts</hi> allowance,
<note place="margin">Matth. 8.30</note> we are to take notice, that it is not to be reckoned ſo much the act of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as his ſimple permiſsion; and that not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his own accord, but being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto entreated by the devils: beſides, they to whom this loſſe did accrew, were without doubt perſons moſt worthy of it, and withall, that loſſe might have brought them greater profit, if they would have made that uſe of that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they might have done: it is true

               <p n="2">2. We are alſo for this reaſon to think, that this power was common but to a few, namely, leſt otherwiſe it might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have been abuſed, and ſometimes been made the inſtrument of wrath and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or at leaſt of unſeaſonable ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: All had not ſo great wiſdom as <hi>Paul</hi> and the other <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſo as to know on <hi>what perſons,</hi> and <hi>in what nick of time,</hi> and <hi>with what meaſure</hi> to inflict ſuch puniſhments: all had not the like <hi>meekneſſe</hi> and <hi>long animity</hi> with him, or them: we may ſee by the fore-alleadged teſtimonies how hardly <hi>Paul</hi> could be induced to make uſe of that ſeverity which he had in his power: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who hold, that <hi>this power</hi> was then common to the <hi>Paſtors of Churches,</hi> have no true ground to ſupport their opinion, yea it is evidently againſt reaſon ſo to think: <hi>Paul</hi> ſure had had but little need, when he was willing to challenge that power to himſelf, ſo carefully to prevent
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169709:53"/>the ſuſpition of arrogance in ſo doing, if that his had bin alſo common to the <hi>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Corinthians,</hi> &amp; every where elſe uſual in the <hi>Church:</hi> and though in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. he would have the conſent of the Church to concurre towards the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering of the <hi>inceſtuous perſon to Satan;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.3.4</note> yet he aſcribes <hi>the decree</hi> of delivering that perſon to <hi>Satan,</hi> not to that Church, but only to himſelf, and ſo attributes the effect it ſelf of that thing only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to the <hi>power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> like as alſo he doth not preſcribe, that <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould be delivered <hi>by Timothy to Satan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.20</note> but ſayes that he himſelf had <hi>delivered</hi> them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we are to think <hi>this power</hi> to have expired with the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and with other extraordinary divine perſons, like them: ſo far is it from belonging to an ordinary power, and that which at preſent is <hi>remaining in the Church.</hi>

               <p>By the power of theſe it was chiefly, that the world came ſo quickly to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and brought in obedience to the <hi>Faith;</hi> when it ſaw thoſe men who were the preachers of this faith (though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of like infirmities with others) aſſiſted with ſuch a divine power, as to alter the courſe of nature, and do thoſe things which all the powers of the world combined together could not effect: how muſt not they hereupon but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced to believe, that what theſe men preached (unleſſe they would be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, as to imagine that God whom all naturally acknowledge to be moſt true and good ſhould lend that power, which he affords to no others, to liars and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers) was no other but the <hi>truth of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as by theſe miracles it chiefly was, that the world came to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a belief of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith;</hi> ſo they were neceſsarily then required for procuring credit to the Goſpel, and for working the world to a ſubmiſſion to it.</p>

               <p>Beſides, the world was then generally poſſeſt with many falſe religions, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt idolatrous worſhips, which being as contrary to the Goſpel as darkneſſe is to light, could not but make their mindes more enraged, and oppoſite to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of it: And further, beſides all this, many ſuch things are affirmed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, namely in the doctrine of the Goſpel, as exceed humane reaſon and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and ſome things hereby are required to be taken away, which were known before, either to have been appointed or at leaſt allowed of by God, and which to that time had remained without any change or alteration: ſo that in all theſe reſpects, that power of <hi>miracles</hi> was then requiſite; that it might fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear (againſt all theſe grounds of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice) that what the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preached to the world, had indeed (as they affirmed) God for the Author of it.</p>

And we are further to conceive this to be the more reaſonable in this reſpect, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the very <hi>doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> for both the parts of it which are his <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>precepts</hi> is of that perfection, as to contain a certain <hi>impreſſe of divinity</hi> in it, which as a kind of <hi>ſtanding miracle</hi> ſpeaks God to be the Authour thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>promiſe of eternal life,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying for ever unſpeakable happineſs and comforts with God himſelf in Heaven, (to which all the other promiſes of the Goſpel are to be reduced) ſavours truly of the majeſty and infinite goodnes of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, being a reward fully ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to both theſe, and therefore it cannot be but the more probable in this reſpect, that he will thus reward his <hi>faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:</hi> wiſe and liberall Princes being wont magnificently to reward their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and truſty miniſters, by giving thoſe things to them which are rather propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to their own greatneſs, then to the deſerts or low condition of theſe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:169709:57"/>2. The <hi>precepts</hi> rightly underſtood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch ſingular divine expreſsions of holineſs and righteouſneſs to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in a manner exhibited by us, as imply not onely a full conſonancy to that <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>rectitude,</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> that are in God, but alſo that no other but hee could be the original Authour and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of them; ſo that there cannot be need that the belief of both, or either of theſe to come from him, ſhould be ſtill <hi>wrought,</hi> or <hi>ſupported by miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hence we may conceive the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that difference of Gods diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this kind, betwixt the <hi>time of the law,</hi> and <hi>this of the Goſpel:</hi> then while that worſhip or religion of the <hi>law</hi> was ſtanding, and was of right to be in force, there were in ſucceſsions of time <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>iterated apparitions of Angels</hi> as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine meſsengers from God, and alſo now and then in ſeveral ages downwards from <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſome <hi>miracles</hi> were wrought for upholding the credit and authority of that worſhip: the reaſon whereof we are to conceive this, that there were in neither of the <hi>integral parts</hi> of that <hi>religion</hi> any ſuch <hi>impreſſes of divinity,</hi> as could of themſelves prove God to be the originall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169709:57"/>Authour of them; and therefore there was but need that this defect ſhould bee ſupplied by the continuance of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick evidences, of miracles and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions of Angels.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The things expreſſely promiſed in that religion were onely temporal things, and ſuch as in the apprehenſion of many, have ſtill ſeemed to depend on, and be adminiſtred to men by chance; ſo that when God did really confer according to his promiſe thoſe profits on them, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and encouragements of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, there could not but be danger of their not acknowledging or taking notice of them, as ſuch; eſpecially when they could not but know, many not onely that were ignorant of God, but alſo who were notoriouſly refractory to him, to abound in the ſame things. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. The very temporary and vaniſhing nature of theſe things (all which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of any ſolid happineſſe are but as a ſmoak or ſhadow) eſpecially being joyned with the former conſideration might make them doubt, whether God did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed order and appoint them, as rewards of his ſervants; as being neither ſuitable to his own ſpirituall nature, nor to that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169709:58"/>unlimited goodneſſe, which they could not but know to be in him; and ſo in both theſe reſpects, ſuch as might ſeem after a manner unworthy of him: and for both theſe reaſons we may conceive that that ſupply by the continuance of miracles was then needfull to convince them in this matter, ſo as to make them look upon theſe things promiſed them, when they enjoyed them as gifts and rewards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from God.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe in theſe two reaſons ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the promiſes of the law, there is one thing taken for granted which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (I doubt) will confidently deny, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the bleſſings expreſſely promiſed under the <hi>law,</hi> were only temporal things, and conſequently, that eternal life was not then revealed, or in that manner promiſed to men; I ſhall adde ſomething, briefly, by way of confirmation hereof.</p>
               <p>The truth of this then I conceive may ſufficiently appear hence,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>five books of Moſes,</hi> wherein the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> religion is contained, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us no <hi>expreſſe promiſe</hi> of eternal life. or of any other bleſſings then what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to this life, In theſe places, <hi>Ex.</hi> 23. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.28. the promiſes w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> God
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169709:58"/>thought fit to make to that people, are purpoſely, and moſt fully, and particularly recited; and yet there is not in any of them, the leaſt mention of eternall life, which ſure, if it had been a thing then promiſed, ought more expreſſely to have been there inſiſted on and inculcated, then all the things there named; as infinitely exceeding them all, and conſequently, that which would have been of more force then all the reſt, to have contained that people then in obedience to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> the revelation of eternal life is appropriated unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as where it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 1.10.</note> that <hi>hee hath brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel;</hi> and,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.22.25.</note> 
                  <hi>that life which was with the Father</hi> (that is hid in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and decree) <hi>he</hi> is ſaid <hi>to have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to us:</hi> and again, <hi>this is the promiſe that he hath promiſed us, even eternal life:</hi> and many other ſayings to the like effect. Beſides, there was among the <hi>Jewes</hi> a Sect of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and that ſomewhat ancient in <hi>Chriſts</hi> time, which Sect though it was not perhaps very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, yet it had the moſt of the chief perſons, or rulers adhering to it,
<note place="margin">lib. 15. to 2.</note> as <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> teſtifies; and in the time of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:169709:59"/>and of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the chief of the prieſts were of this Sect, as may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from <hi>Act.</hi> 5.17. Now this Sect (as it is well known) did deny the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead, and the immortality of the ſoul; which ſure, being ſuch perſons as they were, they would never have done, if eternall life had been expreſly promiſed in thoſe books which were of divine authority with them.</p>
               <p>As for that which may be objected to the contrary, touching the opinion of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in our <hi>Saviours</hi> and the <hi>Apostles</hi> time about this matter; we may conceive, that this acknowledgement of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead and the immortality of the ſoul did proceed hence, either 1. the deſire of immortality, wherewith we are all naturally poſseſsed, made them fancy ſuch a future condition, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſome places of ſcripture (though not truly ſo fign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ficant) to this ſenſe; or elſe 2. being excited into a hope of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, by the ingrafted appetite and deſire of it, they did thus far give credit unto <hi>Christ,</hi> as upon his publike preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it firmly to believe it?</p>
               <p>For that they did not before <hi>Chriſts</hi> preaching, believe ſuch a reſurrection of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169709:59"/>of the righteous or of the dead, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> publiſhed: the ſame <hi>Joſephus</hi> fully teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in the forecited place; where he tells us, <hi>that they did believe the ſouls of wicked men to be ſhut up under the earth in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual priſon, and the ſouls of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous after ſome time to remove thence, and go into other bodies:</hi> he not adding any thing more touching their faith in this point.</p>
               <p>Now notwithſtanding all this, I do not deny, but that</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Eternal Life</hi> was in ſome kinde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, yea and promiſed under the Old Teſtament, but this was <hi>figuratively</hi> and <hi>myſtically;</hi> that is, in ſuch a dark, and involved way, that none ordinarily could ſee ſuch promiſe, or build any firm hopes of the thing ſo promiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: God had it ever (I grant) in his purpoſe and decree to reward his faithful ſervants, even thoſe before <hi>Christs</hi> time, as well as thoſe after, with eternal life, and ſo the former ſhal aſſuredly be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto, for <hi>God hath prepared for them a city,</hi> but this decree God did not think fit to make known to them, God dealing with them in this reſpect, as with Servants, to whom maſters uſe not to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169709:60"/>make known all their mindes; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily dealing with us, in this kinde as with Sons; by communicating to us the full knowledge of his will, and by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and plainly acquainting us with his gracious intention of beſtowing his heavenly inheritance upon us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I do not deny neither, but that the ſervant; of God, under the Law, might (notwithſtanding they had no ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as we have ſpoke of, made them) have ſome hopes and expectation of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bleſſedneſſe, or eternal life; and that not only excited in them by their earneſt deſires of it; but alſo, becauſe they could not but know, that there was truly ſuch a thing, (it being not unknown to them that God himſelf did live ſuch a life, and that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Eliah</hi> were rapt up into a poſſeſſion of it) and for that, they could not but alſo apprehend ſuch a bleſſedneſſe moſt ſuitable with Gods goodneſſe to beſtow; eſpecially, when they ſaw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods ſervants fall ſhort of thoſe temporal bleſſings, that were literally and plainly promiſed to them.</p>
               <p>But yet, all this being granted; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains firm which I have before aſſerted; that there was no other, but only tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169709:60"/>things plainly and expreflely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the <hi>Jews</hi> under the law, and ſo, that their promiſes then had that imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in them, which thoſe made to us in the Goſpel are free from.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A great part of the Precepts which made up the other part of that Religion, namely, the ceremonial part of it, ſeem ſo light &amp; ſuperſtitious, and outwardly fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh &amp; ridiculous in themſelves; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo unbeſeeming the Wiſdom and Majeſty of God; that it could not but be neceſſary for making men truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, God to be the Author of them, and of that form of worſhip wherein they were commanded, that he ſhould by this outward teſtimony be ever and anon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himſelf ſo to own and approve them.</p>
               <p>But it may be here (as it is by ſome) objected, that though the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be truly divine above that of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> and ſo have the teſtimony as it were in its ſelf of its coming from God; yet ſeeing it was alwayes ſo, even when it was firſt publiſht to the world; there cannot but be now, conſidering the great and general corruption that hath been made in it, through the defection under
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169709:61"/>Antichriſt, and alſo the many different and repugnant opinions that are held by the ſeveral Profeſſours of it, a like neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of having the Authority and truth thereof declared, and ratified by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as there was formerly, when it came firſt new into the world.</p>
               <p>In anſwer whereunto I ſay; that theſe things being granted touching the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and contrary opinions in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, yet the caſe is much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in reſpect of the neceſſity of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, betwixt this and that firſt time, when this Religion was firſt preacht: for then, when this Religion was firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be planted as there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Religions in the world, and that of a long continuance, with the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and practiſe of which, this could not poſſibly conſiſt; ſo there were no certain principles common to this and them, out of which the authority of this, and falſhood or abrogation of thoſe, might be manifeſtly demonſtrated; yea this religion or doctrine of Chriſt did plainly grant the principles of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion (under which <hi>Chriſt</hi> was born, and which was yet in part to be aboliſht by him, and in a manner totally changed)
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169709:61"/>to have proceeded from God; ſo that it could not but be fully neceſſary that the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in ſome admirable manner, and that God by evident and infallible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments ſhould be demonſtrated to be the Author of it: but now, after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and corruption wrought by <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> in Chriſtian Religion, not only the principles of this doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but alſo the whole and entire doctrine it ſelf according to their opinion who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the foreſaid defection, hath remained unviolated in the written Records of holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> being ſo preſerved by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable providence and goodneſſe of God during that defection; and to theſe <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> all that profeſſe themſelves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, even thoſe who are guilty of that defection, and acknowledge aſſent to be due as to the infallible <hi>oracles of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe <hi>Scriptures</hi> (we ſay) are ſo clear in thoſe things which are ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be known, that the meaning of them cannot but be apprehended by any who truly deſire to know it, and have not their underſtandings blunted by their own voluntary fault; and this may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from hence, that the greateſt part of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169709:62"/>them were either from the beginning common to the vulgar people, or ſent to ſuch perſons to be read and underſtood by them, who were in a manner rude, or novices in <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and partly involved in many great errours: ſuch as diverſe of thoſe were to whom ſome <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> were directed,
<note place="margin">Epiſtles to the Corinth. and Galat.</note> and yet in which we finde the greateſt myſteries of this Religion communicated by him to the ſaid perſons.</p>
               <p>Indeed the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> had been written and publiſht in vain, if ſo be that every one by reading of them, and uſing that prayer and diligence which is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him, could not of himſelf attain the ſenſe thereof, ſo far as may be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for him to know it, but that, it were neceſſary (as is ordinarily by many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for maintaining idleneſſe in ſome, and pride in others) to ſeek and receive the menaing thereof from a certain ſort of men, as <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours,</hi> either ſevered or conveened in Synods: for it had been much better (the caſe being ſo) that there were no ſuch <hi>Scriptures</hi> vulgarly extant, but only that it were commanded that univerſal credit ſhould be given to that ſort of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169709:62"/>men, in the knowledge of divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who alſo themſelves by this means ſhould have had no need of theſe ſacred volumes; but it had been enough for them to have had the knowledge of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things begot and preſerved in them by the immediate power of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and ſo we might ſuppoſe that to have been done in all the doctrines of Religion, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> contend to have been done in many of them, namely, that from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times they ſhould be without writing preſerved pure, and delivered by perpetual tradition from one age to another.</p>
               <p>But to return; as all generally ſo far acknowledge the authority of the <hi>Books of Scripture,</hi> as to hold that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contained in them, which is not certainly moſt true (when as there is not, nor can be any ſuch certainty pretended touching their interpretations, who are accounted the expoſitors of it) ſo that perſpicuity which we aſcribe to them is implicitely and in effect granted even by thoſe who directly deny it, and ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the holding of many corruptions that are repugnant to the ſaid Scriptures, to wit the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> For whence elſe is it,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169709:63"/>that they are not willing to have thoſe controverſies that are agitated betwixt them and us, to be decided only by the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> yea whence is it elſe, that they pretend the interpretation of theſe <hi>Scriptures</hi> is to be ſetcht from their Church, but only that they know, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, that there is a plain and evident ſenſe of the ſame <hi>Scriptures</hi> that makes againſt them? and yet whether they will or no, they are at length forced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo to have their recourſe to the ſaid <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to prove thence that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which they arrogate to their Church, without which pretended and thus ſeemingly proved authority, they cannot finde how they may ſo much as in ſhow or appearance, in any manner main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their falſe opinions.</p>
               <p>Since then it may appear from what hath been ſaid, that there are, and ſtill have been, ſome common and univerſally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved principles among all Chriſtians, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Holy-Scriptures,</hi> from which the falſhood of ſuch opinions as are contrary to faith, and hinderances of ſalvation may be demonſtrated; and ſince alſo that the ſaid <hi>Scriptures</hi> are ſo clear in ſuch matters, and by all thoſe that receive them, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169709:63"/>or indirectly, and in effect confeſt to be ſo; there cannot be any neceſſity imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, why miracles ſhould bee continued, or at preſent renewed for the declaring of what is divine truth in this kind; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the foreſaid great defection from and corruption of it. The <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſo remaining and acknowledged, being as a <hi>ſtanding rule,</hi> by the conformity or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonance to which all opinions in matters of ſaith may for the ſoundneſſe or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſſe of them ſufficiently be tried and judged of; and therefore as to require or expect other rules or evidences beyond this, namely, thoſe extraordinary ones of miracles for diſcerning ſuch divine truth, would be a tempting of God on our part; ſo if God ſhould in this caſe when he hath ſo ſufficiently provided for us in reference to this end, conferre the power of working miracles on men; it would be in him a receding from that way of wiſdom which he hath formerly obſerved, by doing that where no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requires, which only in caſes of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he hath uſed to do.</p>
               <p>But it may be here objected, that wee ſee no ſuch effect that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> have, as to keep thoſe who receive and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169709:64"/>entertain them in the enjoyment and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all neceſſary ſaving truths: Chriſtians are ſtill divided by contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and many enſnared in deſtructive errours.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To which I anſwer, 1. that all points and matters of religion are not of that importance, as to be reputed <hi>neceſſariò cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda,</hi> or fundamentals: ſome there are (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> implies in that diſcourſe of his touching <hi>dayes and meats, Rom.</hi> 14. to which others of a like nature may be reduced) in which as men may erre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neceſſarily hazarding their ſalvation; ſo differences of judgement about ſuch matters, if there were that charity which anciently hath been and ought ſtill by the <hi>lawes of Chriſt</hi> to be among Chriſtians) would not produce any breach of peace or amity amongſt them that ſhould ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from one another; ſo long as upon this ſuppoſall ſo much of divine truth is joyntly received and profeſſed by them, as is ſufficient towards the making of them that thus differ, the children of God here, and ſo bringing them to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of that inheritance which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned onely for ſuch hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe errours or differences in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169709:64"/>matters of religion which have been, and are at this day either in fundamentals or in ſome leſſer points among Chriſtians, are not truly to be imputed to any defect in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as if it through its obſcurity were the cauſe or occaſion of them; for (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſayes) if the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (which ſure is contained in his and other <hi>Apoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi> writings now extant) <hi>be hid</hi> or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; it is <hi>ſo onely to them that are loſt,</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169709:65"/>authority, but onely to acquaint them what was the judgement of the Church of thoſe times, or of ſuch perſons and companies of men as then lived, or that yet are remaining in ſuch matters; and that we ſhould not lightly and without good reaſon recede from thoſe opinions which have been approved by them: but for any to extend the authority of any or of all theſe farther, that is, obſtinately to retain ſome opinions, becauſe they are found to bee approved by the foreſaid <hi>Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. when as the <hi>Scripture</hi> in our apprehenſion, and it may be really makes truly againſt them: this is to put out our own eyes and onely to ſee by theirs; yea, this is to put them in the place of God and their judgement in ſtead of his word the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and ſo is that which is not onely a debaſing of our ſelves into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſervility below that wherein God has placed us, and which indeed he hath forbidden us, by making our ſelves thus the <hi>ſervants of men;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23.</note> but is alſo a direct contempt and ſlighting of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and conſequently that which may expect the falling into errours, both as the effect and puniſhment of ſuch contempt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon it; as we ſee at this day it is
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169709:65"/>among <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and ſo proportionably with others, that love in this kinde to tread in their ſteps.</p>
               <p>The truth is, as it would be a perplext and endleſſe way, to go about to trace or finde out divine truth by conſulting the writings of <hi>Fathers,</hi> or written Canons and Decrees of <hi>Councels</hi> of ſeveral Ages, ſome of which are certainly loſt, and the reſt which are extant are not eaſie to be got, nor poſſible to be read by all: and withal, as it would be a way liable to the ſame or rather far greater uncertainty, then that which is pretended by ſome againſt <hi>Scripture,</hi> for the ſeeming obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it; in regard thoſe <hi>Fathers and Councels</hi> do not only abound in equally obſcure expreſſions, as may appear to thoſe that read them, and from the uſe that contrary parties make of them; but alſo often contradict one another, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſometimes do alſo, or at leaſt may be thought as men to contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: whereas the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath every where, (and ſo is acknowledged gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by all to have) a full and perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonancy with it ſelf: ſo by ſo doing, that is, by ſetting them thus over us to be guided by their judgement in our aſſent
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169709:66"/>to divine matters, and as it were tying our ſelves up to the rule of their ſtandard in meaſuring ſacred truths; we ſhould not onely be forced to re-admit ſome things as truths in this kinde, which have been, and that deſervedly rejected by the firſt <hi>Reformers;</hi> but alſo to confeſſe the <hi>Reformation</hi> or change in Religion made by them, to be in reſpect of moſt of the points of it groundleſſe and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: ſeeing it is plain, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> can, and ordinarily do alledge abundant teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies out of the foreſaid <hi>Councels and Fathers</hi> writings, and that without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie or wreſting for upholding thoſe their opinions and practiſes in Religion, which were then, and we think ſtill of right ought to to be, notwithſtanding the credit of ſuch authority condemned and relinquiſht by us.

                  </gap>ity of them in thoſe times of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> to which they were peculiarly limited; being then requiſite weapons for ſubduing the <hi>Heathen</hi> world to the obedience of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> I am now to ſhow, that there are other weapons ſomething proportionable to thoſe extraordinary ones forementioned, which are common to our times, and partake truly of that mightineſſe for pulling down <hi>ſtrong holds</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of; and theſe we may conceive (as the former) to be of two ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One, in the uſe of it reſpecting thoſe within the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other reſpecting thoſe that are without.</p>
               <p>The former is anſwerable in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to that extraordinary power the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had of <hi>delivering</hi> up ſome ſort of Perſons to <hi>Satan,</hi> and it is that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the church it ſelf to make uſe of, namely <hi>Excommunication,</hi> that is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of perſons that are ſcandalous, as <hi>Drunkards, Swearers, Adulterers,</hi> or any
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169709:67"/>that live in any ſin contrary to the known laws of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from the Company of the faithful; and this ſeparation according to the quality of the ſin, and condition of the ſinner is twofold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Imperfect, when one is excluded from having any intimate familiarity, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the faithful: yet ſo as he is ſuffered to remain a member ſtill in ſome manner of the Church, by partaking of hearing the word preacht. This ſeparation is that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> means, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to <hi>withdraw our ſelves from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brother that walks diſorderly;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3.6.14. 1 Cor. 5.11.</note> 
                  <hi>if any obey not the word, to note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be aſhamed; and with ſuch an one not to eat:</hi> and the perſons that are thus to be ſeparated from, are (as theſe alledged pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces imply) ſuch, as are ſo involved in the <hi>habit</hi> of one or moe ſins, that yet there are ſome hopes left of their recovery out of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Perfect ſeparation, when one is quite excluded from the Company and Congregation of believers, ſo as he is not any longer admitted or reputed a member of the Church: and the perſons that are thus to be excluded, are ſuch as
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169709:67"/>obſtinately go on in their ſins, and ſuffer all the admonitions, and reprehenſions that are beſtowed on them to be in vain; whence it may plainly appear, that they make no true account of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo are not to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned as his ſervants or Schollers, and therefore are fit to be excluded out of the number of thoſe that profeſſe themſelves ſuch.</p>
               <p>Now that there is ſuch a power given and commended to the Church, appears hence. 1. That the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> reprchends the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for not excluding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous perſon from amongſt them.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.26.</note> 2. That our <hi>Saviour</hi> requires, that he, who being privately and publickly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſht and convinc't of his ſin, and yet obeyes not the Church, ſhall be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a <hi>Heathen and Publican;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 18.17.18.</note> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſayes, that he, <hi>who is ſo bound on earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And touching both theſe ſorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that this is the alone weapon, which the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is authoriz'd by his Commiſsion in this caſe to make uſe of againſt any ſuch as walk contrary to the rule, or hold any opinion repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169709:68"/>thereunto: as for theſe other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, as namely <hi>bonds, fines, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.</hi> which (as we ſhewed before) are altogether ineffectuall for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Religion; they are all of a later date, being invented and brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world by the <hi>Spirit of Antichriſt,</hi> which as it hath corrupted the pure and ſpiritual doctrin of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in other things, with many corrupt and carnal inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo it hath inſtead of this weapon (which rightly uſed ſerves for reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and healing the perſons againſt whom it is imployed, that <hi>his ſpirit may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the day of the Lord,</hi> and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a degree of the greateſt charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him) brought in the uſe of thoſe other weapons which have no power at all to heal, but only to deſtroy; and ſo manifeſt the greateſt cruelty that can be uſed.</p>
               <p>Now the ſpecial ends and uſes for which this weapon was at firſt appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and for which it is, or ought ſtill to be continued in the Church, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To provide hereby for the credit of the Church, and the honour of religion, and the profeſſours of it; that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169709:68"/>of either, nor any other might have occaſion to think, or ſpeak evil of the Church, as if it willingly connived at, or harboured any unclean or ſinful perſons in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the reſt that are members of it might ſomewhat the better through the fear of this cenſure or puniſhment which is ratify'd in Heaven, be contain'd within the compaſſe of their duty, or the ſooner return again to themſelves, upon their beginning to decline from it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That hereby the ſpreading of the contagion of ſin might be prevented; for as (according to the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>) <hi>a little leaven leavens the whole lump;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.6.</note> ſo one ſuch ſinner ſuffer'd without ſuch cenſure inflicted on him makes others lyable to be infected by him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That thoſe that are thus wounded may ſo come to be healed; that is, that by this means having juſt occaſion given them to take notice of their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, in that they are excluded as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wo thy of having any communion with the people of God, or of partaking of any benefit from his word; they may come to be aſhamed, and ſo unfainedly reform their wayes.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:169709:69"/>
               <p>Now the conſideration of all this gives us juſt cauſe to complain of, and bewail the conſtitution of our Church, as it is at preſent, and hath been of late yeers: we have indeed, and have had the <hi>word of God</hi> long amongſt us, and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect are happy above many that want it, if we knew how to eſteem and make uſe of it; but this weapon belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the word, and ſo many wayes uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for upholding the credit of the word, and for the good of thoſe that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of it, is and hath been long quite out of uſe, wholly laid aſide and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected with us. It was (I know) hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the Government of <hi>Biſhops</hi> was ſtanding, ſometimes drawn out and imployed, but for the moſt part the edge of it was turned a wrong way, namely, againſt ſome contempt of thoſe that were then in Authority, for not paying fees, or diſobeying the orders of their Courts, or refuſing to obſerve ſome petty Crere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, &amp;c. as for other great matters immediately reſpecting God, and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diſhonour of Religion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of mens fouls; as drinking, ſwearing &amp;c. theſe were things, I do not remember, it was ever much imployed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169709:69"/>againſt; perſons that were known tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours in theſe, if not otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory to their orders, might have free liberty to partake in the ordinances of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and communion in the Church, as well as they that were moſt upright and unblameable in their lives.</p>
               <p>And the matter in this reſpect is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all mended with us; ſcandalous and openly vitious perſons of all ſorts (if their crimes have not proceeded ſo far as to make them be ſhut up in the Goal, and ſo thereby be hindred) have free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe into our aſſemblies, and to our moſt ſolemn and ſacred meetings: yea, ſuch our aſſemblies and meetings are not ſpotted here and there with ſome one or other ſuch perſons (as the <hi>Church of Corinth</hi> was with one inceſtuous perſon) but quite in a manner over-run and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with them: ſo that all theſe evils, for the preventing and curing whereof that weapon of <hi>Excommunication</hi> was appointed; are now through the want of it, not only to be ſeen amongſt us, but in a manner are become remedileſſe: The credit of our Church is hereby daily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and the Religion we profeſſe is expoſed with ſtrangers and enemies, to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169709:70"/>ſcorn and reproach; thoſe that are not yet tainted, through ſuch impunity are made leſſe carefull to avoid the like ſins, yea, by their promiſcuous converſing with ſuch ſcandalous perſons, are made lyable to be, and ſo we ſee daily they are infected with the ſame corruptions; and laſtly, thoſe perſons themſelves come by this means to go on (as we ſee they do) all their dayes without any remorſe or ſhame, which can only work repentance to ſalvation; and ſo they live and die in a moſt deſperate hopeleſſe condition.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are truly lamentable to conſider, but alas it is not in my power, neither is it in your power (yours I mean who are ſome wayes ſenſible of theſe evils, as all good Chriſtians who either tender the glory of God, or ſalvation of mens ſouls cannot but be) to help theſe things, further then by contributing our prayers, that God would put it into the hearts of thoſe who have the power of reforming things in their hands, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſome of their care effectually upon this buſineſs; namely, that godlineſs and all things that truly make for it may be encouraged, and countenanced, and ſo brought into credit: and contrarily that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169709:70"/>all wickedneſſe and impiety whatſoever, and in whomſoever may be diſgraced and diſcountenanced, and noted with ſome marke of infamy in the wilfull and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate actors of it; that ſo, they might be brought to ſhame (as the word requires they ſhould) for their amendment. In the mean time, it will concerne you who have theſe deſires to do your utmoſt to counter-act this great evill and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, <hi>to make straight paths for your feet</hi> amidſt this crooked generation, to take care not onely ſo as to avoid the evill of ſuch perſons you live amongſt; but aſmuch as may be, of having any converſation or familiarity with them; to place your delight in, and make choice of ſuch for your company and friends (if there be any ſuch,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.3.</note> as I hope there are) as <hi>David</hi> calls the <hi>Saints that are in the earth:</hi> ſuch as <hi>love righteouſneſſe and hate iniquity;</hi> ſuch as have <hi>eſcaped thoſe pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> the greateſt part everywhere live in, practizing acts of vertue and holineſſe; and that they may the better know to practiſe theſe, willingly talke and conferre with others about theſe things that make for them, you that are ſuch, or deſire to be ſuch, let me exhort you in the bowels
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169709:71"/>of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> more and more to honour ſuch, to deſire and delight in their company; to delight in them ſo farre, as they that are not ſuch, or declare themſelves not to care for being ſuch, may fee, that even for this reaſon they are not at all delighted in, or accounted of by you: Thus doing, you may do ſomewhat towards vindicating the honour of religion, and credit of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and perhaps towards working ſhame in ſuch perſons; at leaſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you ſhall declare to thoſe that are willing to take notice of it, that though ſuch perſons be amongſt you, yet they are not of you; though you cannot avoid having an outward communion with them, yet you do not own them for Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that is for <hi>Chriſtian Brethren,</hi> nor ſo account of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are other weapons propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to theſe miracles wrought by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> requiſite in all the members of the Church for ſubduing of others, that is, for bringing them that are ſtrangers or enemies to Chriſt in ſubmiſſion to him, or thoſe that are onely titular and nominall Chriſtians, to become true converts: and they are no other (as wee have before inſinuated) but thoſe Chriſtian graces or
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169709:71"/>vertues commended to us in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which are principally required for our ſelves, to render us heirs of ſalvation; but have alſo a certain ſecret force of working upon others, in which reſpect they may truly be called <hi>weapons:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe we are to conceive the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> had together with thoſe miracles, without which it was not poſſible that theſe miracles could have had that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, which we before ſhewed they had in conquering the world, that is, ſo as to work ſuch multitudes as they did, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh all their old ſuperſtitions which they were ſo long accuſtomed to, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them, their many ſinfull and wicked practiſes which accompany the ſaid ſuperſtitions; and to live ever after not only in the profeſſion of the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but in an anſwerable practice of all theſe harſh and unpleaſing duties to the fleſh, that is of all theſe heavenly vertues commended to them therein.</p>
               <p>This I ſay had not been poſſible, if they that acted theſe miracles, and talked as they did in their preaching of ſuch great and glorious things to be enjoyed hereafter, as a <hi>heavenly kingdome</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life,</hi> ſhould have taken any other
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169709:72"/>courſe themſelvs for coming thither, then what they had ſo commended to others in their preaching: If they ſhould have taught men that they muſt by <hi>patience and meekneſſe, and contempt of the world,</hi> &amp;c. expect only to be made partakers of thoſe things, and themſelves in the mean time have expreſſed <hi>impatience or pride, or worldlineſſe,</hi> &amp;c. for why might they not then thus think and accordingly reſolve within themſelves? that however the miracles they ſee the Apoſtles do, gave them cauſe to believe that there were ſuch things to be indeed enjoyed hereafter, as they mentioned; yet ſince they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did not take that way for coming to the ſaid things, which they preſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others; it was no way neceſſary for that end; ſuch perſon (they might well think) ſurely could not but know, what was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſt for themſelves, and ſo long as their courſes were agreeable to theirs, they might without doubt arrive at the ſame port of happineſſe that they aymed at, and had acquainted the world with.</p>
               <p>This I ſay in all likelihood had been the fruit of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> miracles and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if they had not had theſe weapons alſo: if their lives had been diſagreeing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169709:72"/>to the Majeſtie ſhining forth in the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought by them, that is, if they had been ſordid, or worldly, or ſtained with any ſinful pollution. But we finde, they were far of another temper; they did not only <hi>magna loqui,</hi> but <hi>vivere,</hi> they did not only talk of great matters, but live like men of great expectations; they did not as the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> ſpeak and publiſh exact diſcourſes in commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of temperance, and contentedneſſe, &amp;c. when themſelves were guilty of palpable intemperance, and covetouſneſſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they, like as ſome now, who talk much of another world, and live ſo as if all their hopes and happineſſe were in this; greedily hunting after the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and profits of it: but they truly acted what they taught; They taught, that Heaven is worth all that here poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly is to be laid out for it, that this world is nothing being compared to it; that nothing here is ſo hard to be acted, or harſh to be ſuffered, that is not to be gone through with, out of hopes of it: and they accordingly ſhewed this in their own practiſe, leaving no parts of godlineſſe unpractiſed; ſpending their dayes incontinued and unwearied exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169709:73"/>of all Chriſtian vertues, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the many outward diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they met with; and at length, as occaſion was offered, readily giving up their lives, and parting with this world and all the comforts of it at once, out of a certain expectation of that which they had ſo commended.</p>
               <p>And by this means eſpecially it was, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> brought others to have the like eſteem, and expectation of this future condition, and ſo to take the ſame way for coming to it; making them by this means their converts, and conquering them thus to be their followers in the ſame way to Heaven, who before were their enemies and perſecutors.</p>
               <p>And by this means muſt we (if ever indeed we would effectually work upon others) make our attempt upon them, not ſo much by our words, as by our actions; not ſo much by telling them, that theſe and theſe things they muſt do, if ever they hope to come to Heaven, as by ſhewing them in our own practiſe, that we our ſelves have truly no hopes of coming thither but by ſo doing, that is, by expreſſing that temperance, and meekneſſe, and humility, and heavenly
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:169709:73"/>mindedneſſe, which the Scripture every where commends to us: <hi>Si vis me flere, dolendum est primum ipſe tibi,</hi> if thou wouldeſt have another tender of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſin, or mourn for it after it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, expreſſe ſuch tenderneſſe and mourning firſt in thy ſelf; if thou wouldſt have another zealous, and carefull, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the practice of religious duties, then firſt manifeſt the like zeale and care, and conſtancy, in thy own performance of them: This is the onely right way, and that which onely can be expected to prove effectuall for pulling down of <hi>ſtrong holds,</hi> that is, for ſilencing and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing all the oppoſite reaſonings and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the fleſh or carnall wiſdome: words in themſelvs are but as wind and ſo we find it was acknowledged by a certain learned and acute <hi>Philoſopher,</hi>

               <p>'Tis true, all are not to be expected to be ſo wrought upon, neither indeed ever were they: the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their abounding in the uſe of theſe weapons, and alſo the aſſiſtance of thoſe other extraordinary ones of miracles, had ſtill many enemies, ſuch as did ſtand out <hi>contradicting and blaſpheming;</hi> yea <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf that was the moſt pure and perfect copy in this kind could not for all this prevaile upon all thoſe that were hearers of his doctrine, and eye-witneſſes of his miracles, and of the continued zeal and goodneſſe that ſhined forth in his life: Many have the love of the world ſo ſetled in their hearts, carnall and ſenſuall affections ſo deeply rooted in them, that theſe weapons can make no impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, all the exhortations, or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:169709:75"/>of the ſervants of God, how eminent ſoever can have no power to prevail with them; yea, though one ſhould come from the dead they would not be converted by him: but yet we are not to conceive all who are yet ſtrangers, or for the preſent, enemies to godlineſſe to be of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: there is a difference to be conceived in unregenerate perſons (as it is plain, there was amongſt the <hi>heathen,</hi> and ſtill is amongſt the like ſort of men) ſome of a more flexible, others of a more inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſition to goodneſſe; ſome far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, and others nearer to the kingdom of God, that is, to the admiſſion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of thoſe means which can onely render a man actually capable of that place; though who they are that are ſo is onely perfectly known to God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is ordinarily in all, even in the worſt ſort of men ſo much of that divine light which God hath made naturall to the ſoul remaining, as ſerves to make them own and even tacitly to admire vertue in others, when it cleerly and fully appears; though they are not willing (becauſe of the difficulties and unpleaſingneſſe in it to their ſenſuall deſires) to be practiſers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of themſelves: and for this reaſon alſo,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169709:75"/>for the moſt part they labour to obſcure the appearance thereof in others, ſo as they may not be thought to be what indeed they are.</p>
               <p>Now by this, it may appear that theſe ſpiritual weapons; notwithſtanding the great wickedneſſe, and oppoſition of men againſt them, are ſtill very uſeful ſo as they can never want wholly of their effect: beſides that, which they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and directly ſerve for, namely the fencing or ſecuring the perſons that have and uſe them from the wrath to come, there is a further good may be expected from them, that is, a ſubduing of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe in ſome or other; a vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in time to the practiſe of that piety which yet they are enemies to; yea, and even in the moſt wicked, and ſuch as hate to be reformed, a blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at leaſt of their enmity and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to goodneſs.</p>
               <p>This then layes the greater obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon all that truly fear God; ſuch as are to be conceived to have theſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in their poſſeſſion, to be the more diligent and induſtrious in the uſing of them, to ſtir up (I mean) the grace of God in themſelves to practiſe vigorouſly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:169709:76"/>and inceſſantly thoſe vertues that they hear daily commended to them out of the word, and which the Spirit of God hath in ſome meaſure already wrought in them; not to remit, not to abate of their care in theſe things, but daily to abound and grow ſtronger, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in the performance of them; you have heard that the ſubduing, that is, the ſalvation of others depends much here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; theſe things are truly <hi>mighty through God</hi> for demoliſhing the ſtrong holds of ſin, for ſilencing all the carnall reaſonings of the fleſh againſt the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of godlineſſe, for working thoſe that yet go on in diſhonouring God to joyn with you in glorifying of him; in brief, to turn a ſinner from the errour of his wayes, and ſo ſave that ſoul from death which ſhould otherwiſe eternally periſh: Oh then, if there be in you, any true zeal for, or care of theſe things (as ſure there is, or elſe you are not ſuch perſons, as I now ſpeak to) if the glory of God be dear to you, if your own or others ſouls be pretious in your ſights, then ſlacken not your pace in the courſe of godlineſſe; give all diligence to be every day more <hi>abounding in the work of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169709:76"/>the Lord,</hi> more zealous and heavenly in ſpiritual exerciſes; more fruitful in works of rrghteouſneſſe and holineſſe: in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe things,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.16</note> you ſhall <hi>both ſave your ſelves and others;</hi> that is, be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, effectual inſtruments through the power of God for ſaving others; and ſo partake in that honour (which belongs primarily and completely only to <hi>Chriſt</hi>) to be called <hi>Saviours,</hi> or preſervers of their ſouls. Oh, let this (I ſay) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and awaken you to be unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in well-doing; to go on without fainting; that not only your own, but the good of other ſouls, even of thoſe perhaps that think leaſt of it depends hereupon; who can tell, what may in time be effected by this means? this is certain, you ſhall give others hereby oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to come out of their ſins, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God; and if they be ſo obſtinate as to neglect it, yet your charity herein is not the leſſe, and your ſo doing ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the furtherance of your own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this obligation lye upon you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, thus to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their converſion, then you are to conceive your ſelves much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned

               <p>So there is an anſwerable power, or rather a greater (through the natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of moſt) in thoſe things which may be called the weapons of the devil, namely, wicked practiſes and examples to bring others in ſubjection unto him, and even to blunt the edge of godlineſs in the ſervants of God: Though your conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (I hope) is ſtronger then to caſt off your firſt Love, and to be drawn away with them into the ſame exceſſe of riot, to be partakers with them in their ſins: yet you may eaſily be wrought through the cunning of the devil to abate of your zeal and care in the practiſe of godlineſs, even by beholding the ſinfulneſſe and number of the ungodly you live among; to obſerve ſo many about you that make no care at all of Religious duties, but practiſe in a manner ſeveral ſorts of iniquity ſecurely and with greedineſſe: This may perhaps prompt you to think,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169709:77"/>that you are well enough ſo long as you are ſo much beyond ſuch perſons, and ſo bring this dampe upon you, to make you reſt and content your ſelves with what you have already attained without ever ſtrugling to proceed further: But for the avoiding of this, I deſire you to take notice, that as you are hereupon concerned to be the more watchful; ſo are you likewiſe to be the more zealous and fruitful; the more wickedneſſe is acted in the place where you live, the more is God diſhonoured, the more is his wrath provok't againſt that place, the more ſouls are ſtill thereby endangered; therefore this ſhould be ſo far from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king you abate, that it ſhould indeed by an <hi>antiperiſtaſis</hi> increaſe thoſe graces and the exerciſes of them in you; ſeeing hereby onely you may help to make up the hedge, and contribute to the ſecuring of the place from the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and their ſouls that are hereby the more in danger, from that danger that they are otherwiſe likely to be enſnared in.</p>

               <p>The things werein ſuch perſons ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the greateſt comfort, and welfare to conſiſt, are to be great or rich or highly accounted of in the world; to paſſe away their time with as much ſatisfaction to their ſenſuall deſires as may be; to avoid the undergoing of any voluntary hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, further then it is ſome wayes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to theſe ends: to all which theſe things of <hi>the ſpirit of God,</hi> (that is, theſe inviſible future things to be enjoyed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother world, and the way propoſed of coming to them, which is, by not onely ſlightly accounting, but even contemning all thoſe thing that are of ſo great and high account here, by contradicting and extinguiſhing all ſenſuall deſires in our ſelves, and by willingly ingaging our ſelves in ſuch duties as are harſh to fleſh

               <p>Now there is a power (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> implies) in the word, as it is edged and inforced by theſe weapons (formerly ſpoken of) in the hands of the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of it, to demoliſh this <hi>hold,</hi> to bring in ſuch a perſon as is thus fortified by this his carnal reaſon againſt <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> as a captive thereunto; and this is by lively &amp; really demonſtating to him in our

               <p>But yet (though we cannot hereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſubdue all) ſo long as there is a poſſibility by this means of bringing in ſome; this implies that there is power in theſe weapons for demoliſhing this <hi>hold,</hi> and that the reaſon why they are not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual upon all, is not truly the ſtrength of this fortreſs to withſtand theſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, but a deliberate and reſolved ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in thoſe that are poſseſsed of it: there being this difference to be conceiv'd betwixt thoſe attempts that are made in this kind upon others, for bringing them in ſubjection unto <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and thoſe that are made ordinarily in war, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering them that ſtand out; the latter uſually are ſucceſsful wholly againſt the wills of the attempted, it being the glory of this war to conſtrain men by violence to ſubmit themſelves and become their captives; but the former in reſpect of the nature of Religion (<hi>Chriſt</hi> being <hi>King only of a willing people</hi>) can be no further ſucceſsful then the perſons attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted yield themſelves in ſome kinde to be wrought upon, or at leaſt do not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and malitiouſly oppoſe themſelves;

               <p>But beſides this general <hi>hold</hi> or reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fleſh, which ſeems common to all natural men; there are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome other more particular <hi>holds</hi> in this kinde intended by the <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> ſuch as have a ſtrength more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and are the peculiar fortreſses of ſome certain ſorts of perſons of the higheſt repute in the world, making their ſubduing, that is, their converſion unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> uſually a harder work then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; and theſe are nothing elſe but thoſe reaſonings which <hi>worldly wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>learning,</hi> and the <hi>enjoyment of great pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> or <hi>riches in the world</hi> ſuggeſt to men,

               <p>Now ſuch perſons may be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either as they were in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, wholly unconverted to ſo much as an outward profeſſion of the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Or as they are now in our times, being outward profeſsours of it, but for the moſt part denying the power thereof, without which they are to be conceived in as bad an eſtate as the former: that is perſons that have need ſtill to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and brought into the way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Touching the former, what their reaſonings were in this kinde, may be collected, partly from what the Scripture either expreſſely teſtifies or implyes; and partly from what we find recorded in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical stories</hi> of the times imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following; the ſumme of both which may be reduced to theſe 2 heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as immediately tend to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the credit of their ſuperſtitions and idolatrous worſhip and cuſtomes, that they were to be ſubdued from.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as tend to diſcredit or vilifie

               <p n="1">1. Touching the firſt head they alledge <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that they were things that they had been long accuſtomed to, of which the world had had a continued and long poſſeſsion; their fathers and fore-fathers for many generations before had been profeſſors of them; and why ſhould not reſpect and credit be given to ſuch anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity? why ſhould not we tread in the ſteps of our fathers, as they have happily done in the ſteps of them that went before them? it cannot but be an arrogating to our ſelves more then is due, and a detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them that which of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them, yea an expoſing them to ſcorn and diſgrace; to diſallow and caſt off that religion, which they ſo long and cloſe were addicted to; and inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of entertain one ſo new, as was never ſo much as heard of, or mentioned in their dayes:

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe wayes of worſhip were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and univerſally uſed; they were
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169709:82"/>not the practiſe, and ſo grounded on the judgement and approbation only of ſome few perſons, or of one nation, but all perſons and nations generally did concur in the ſame judgement and practiſe:

               <p n="3">3.

               <p>Beſides they had been ſo well, &amp; things had ſo flouriſht and thriven with them under this worſhip, that great cauſe they had to have a reverent eſteem of it, and it would be no ſmal folly in them to change it for that which the world had little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of, and might think from that it had, that it was more likely to caſt them upon new miſeries and troubles, then any way better their condition.</p>

               <p>Theſe or the like we may conceive were the reaſonings (or <hi>ſtrong holds</hi>) whereby the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the primitive times, eſpecially the great ones of them were confirmed in their love to, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of their old ſuperſtitions, and ſo conſequently made more oppoſite to the doctrine and religion of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> There are yet ſome other reaſonings that ſerved more directly to fortifie them in their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to this doctrine; and they were nothing elſe but the prejudices and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions that they had againſt it, as</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it was altogether a new worſhip, a thing that the world had not been formerly acquainted with: <hi>may we know</hi> (ſaid ſome at <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>what this new doctrine whereof thou ſpeakeſt,
<note place="margin">Act. 17.19, 20, 18.</note> is, for thou bringeſt certain ſtrange things to our ears?</hi> and in the former verſe, <hi>others ſaid, he ſeems to be a ſetter forth of ſtrange gods, becauſe he preached to them, Jeſus and the reſurrection:</hi> Is there any likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that that ſhould be true, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be believed that the world gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for ſo many ages together hath had no knowledge? may not wee well think that if it were (as is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) a doctrine proceeding from God, he

               <p n="2">2. That the perſons, that were publiſhers &amp; abettors of it, were but obſcure &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons, ſuch as were no way eminent in the world, or equal for learning and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to thoſe that oppoſed it, and ſo likewiſe thoſe that ſubmitted to it, were generally only of the meaner ſort, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble and ſimple perſons of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who could not conſider what was truly for their honour, and therefore were eaſie to be perſwaded to any thing; but for them that were wiſe and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons, and knew how to value their credit in the world: ſuch as the <hi>rulers</hi> and the <hi>Phariſees,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 7.48.</note> they every where ſufficiently declared their diſlike and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt it: and this ſure could not but be another great prejudice to fortifie ſuch in their <hi>gentiliſm,</hi> and ſtanding out againſt the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that it was not only a thing new in it ſelf, But that no others generally ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves commenders or profeſſors of it, but only contemptible and obſcure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:169709:84"/>3. That mens mindes were every where poſſeſſed with hatred againſt it: as <hi>for this ſect</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>we know that every where it is ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 28.22.</note> yea not only ſpoken againſt, but (ſo far ſeemed God from owning or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it) thoſe that were the moſt zealous profeſſors and maintainers of it, met with nothing but bonds and impriſonment, &amp;c ue ty, or infamous deaths, as rewards of their ſervice; the world hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring at once its enmity againſt this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and the profeſſors of it; and alſo its judgement of both: that it held the former as no ſmall crime, and the latter for a ſort of the moſt vile and unworthy perſons, ſuch as were not fit to live in the world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There was another not the leaſt prejudice, which was common both to <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> immediately reſpecting the firſt author of this doctrine himſelf, namely, that he (whom his followers pretended) was now in heaven, and had power (as they affirmed) to beſtow a glorious and eternal life after this, upon his ſervants, which was the only <hi>allective</hi> whereby they could hope to draw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to them; that he when here on
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:169709:84"/>earth, ſhould appear to be no other then a vile, infirm and infamous perſon; that he ſhould be made ſubject to mockings, and whippings, and a wretched death, as his followers have been ſince, without manifeſting any power he had, either of executing any revenge upon the perſons that ſo uſed him, or reſcuing himſelf out of their hands: can it be thought, that the <hi>King of Iſrael,</hi> the glorious <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that was ſo long ſpoke of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets before he came, and had ſuch great and excellent things affirmed of him; that he now when he was come, ſhould be ſo far ſhort of thoſe ordinary kings that went before him, as not only to have no retinue anſwerable in Pomp and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to what they had: but alſo be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſuch indignities, as uſe not to befall any ſave the vileſt ſort of men? is it likely, but if he had been indeed ſuch a perſon, he would either have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf from the Croſſe, or being upon it, he would (as he was deſired) have come down thence, and ſo have manifeſted his power, that his enemies might have believed in him.</p>
               <p>This is that reaſoning that the <hi>Jewes</hi> heretofore and ſtill to this day make uſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169709:85"/>of, for fortifying themſelves in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity and oppoſition againſt the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And thus the great and wiſe ones of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſtrengthned themſelves in the like oppoſition: they could not ſee, how he who was ſo inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious himſelf (as it ſufficiently appeared to the world <hi>Chriſt</hi> was by his meſſengers conſtantly preaching of his croſſe and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings) could ever come to have ſuch a power (as they affirmed he had) of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring ſuch tranſcendent glory on others: neither could they with all their wiſdom and learning apprehend (indeed they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hindred them in this matter) how outward ſufferings and afflictions, and death, which in themſelves, as their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon told them, was the way to or rather made up extreme miſery and unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; how theſe things ſhould be (as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> affirmed they were) the certain road to ſupreme glory and happineſſe: this was in their judgement an abſurd and fooliſh thing to imagine: and ſo, in this reſpect, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the doctrine publiſht by him and his ſervants, became <hi>a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block to the Jewes, and to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles fooliſhneſſe,</hi> the very conſideration and belief of ſomewhat which was true
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169709:85"/>of both (as namely that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſuffered ſuch great evils on earth, and that he had taught, that others by the like ſufferings muſt expect to come to glory and happineſſe) was a ground whereon their wiſdome built ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings as became a ſtrong hold or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe to make them perſiſt in their enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt both. And by all this we ſee, what ſeveral reaſonings or <hi>ſtrong holds</hi> there were, wherewith men were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fenced againſt the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> all which were of neceſſity to be batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red down and demoliſht before it could have entrance into their mindes, or they be brought to yield ſubmiſſion unto him.</p>
               <p>And to theſe may be added ſome other reaſonings in the like kind, but more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately of the devils invention, that <hi>father of lies,</hi> having not that truth in them which the former are to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have for the ground of them, namely, thoſe falſe calumnies raiſed againſt the profeſſours of this doctrine;
<note place="margin">Tertul. Apol. Minut. felix</note> as that they were "<hi>haters of mankind; that their meetings were for ſedition, or to enjoy a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous ſatisfaction of their luſts; that they killed young children, and uſed ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and inchantments, &amp;c.</hi> by which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:169709:86"/>means we muſt conceive further, that men were ſtill more eſtranged, and the <hi>ſtrong holds</hi> erected againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> became more powerfull and hard to be ſubdued.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhould ſhew you, how theſe weapons formerly ſpoke of, in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> and others hands were effectuall in great part for beating down theſe holds, for ſilencing and confuting theſe ſeverall reaſonings: but firſt it will be fit for us to obſerve, by reflecting upon thoſe reaſons that we have named; who they are to be compared to, or rather who they are true imitatours of, that make uſe of the very ſame reaſons in effect (that is, of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>Pagans,</hi> or unbelieving <hi>Jewes</hi>) for their perſiſting in any old opinion or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, or oppoſing of that which is new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perhaps diſcovered; and that it may be, by men of no great eminency in the world.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they plead <hi>antiquity</hi> of thoſe corruptions of theirs which we have rejected: that they and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before them have thus believed and practiſed: They plead alſo <hi>univerſality,</hi> all the Chriſtian world at that time when <hi>Luther</hi> began to oppoſe them, and ſtill
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:169709:86"/>the greateſt part yet hold the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions with them: they plead alſo <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> many learned <hi>Councels and Fathers</hi> heretofore, and at preſent great <hi>Cardinals and Kings,</hi> and men that excell in all kind of learning (as many of their <hi>Jeſuites</hi> do) are not onely profeſſours, but Patrons and maintainers of them; that theſe their corruptions, as we call them, have had the bleſſing of God going along with them; their Churches at preſent (as they have long) flouriſhing in ſplendour and riches and high dignities which they enjoy. And to theſe may be added further, their uſuall allegations againſt that truth wee profeſſe: as its <hi>novelty</hi> when <hi>Luther</hi> firſt publiſht it, where was it (ſay they) for ſo many ages before him? what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons, or company of men can wee name, that held thoſe opinions that we do now? and was all the world blind and ignorant in divine matters, til he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their eyes? and is it likely, that an <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Monke,</hi> as he was, and ſuch others as were his Aſſiſtants ſhould know better the minde of God, or meaning of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> then ſo many learned <hi>Biſhops and Doctours,</hi> as oppoſed them? and did not God ſhow ſufficiently his diſlike, and the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:169709:87"/>world generally their contrary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and enmity againſt this religion, when the firſt profeſſours of it met eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where with bonds and impriſonment, and racking and burnings, &amp;c. yea, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were the more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the belief of Chriſts doctrine, becauſe it taught ſuch a mean way, ſo far from worldly pompe and pleaſure to come to eternall happineſſe and glory; as by ſufferings and afflictions: is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly their prejudice againſt ours the greater, becauſe we have none of thoſe pompous ceremonies and ornaments which make ſo great a ſhew to a carnall eye to ſet it off? and laſtly, that they may not come ſhort in that which is worſt of all; hath it not been the practice of many of their agents, to ſeek by lies and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to draw or deterre men from the profeſſion of it, by telling them in their Books, that <hi>Luther</hi> confeſſed himſelf to have received what hee taught from the devil, and by caſting many foul and black aſperſions upon him and others that were any way active inſtruments in carrying on this work againſt them.</p>
               <p>Now in all this, what do they truly do either for upholding their own, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169709:87"/>our religion, but what the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient enemies of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did towards the retaining of their old ſuperſtition, and keeping out the admiſſion of his doctrine; and ſo by this means ſhew plainly not onely what ſpirit they are of, even of the ſame <hi>Antichristian Spirit</hi> that then mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted it ſelf; but alſo what they would have done, if they had lived in thoſe dayes, and that is, upon the ſame grounds have rejected <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and condemned and perſecuted the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and other primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive profeſſours, and publiſhers of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There are others, who though they ſufficiently ſee and condemn the vanity and arrogance of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in uſing theſe reaſonings, yet ſtill in part by their own practice help to juſtifie them in ſo doing; namely ſuch as are not willing to think well of, or indeed give themſelves liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo much as ſeriouſly to conſider any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that is againſt the generall received doctrine of the <hi>Church,</hi> or contradicts that which ſome ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councels</hi> have heretofore held; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the ſame courſe as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do labour to ſuppreſſe them; as by ſtifling their books, or puniſhing and impriſoning
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169709:88"/>the perſons that are the broachers or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of ſuch opinions; or by uſing ſome ſuch like worldly policy and power: to which perſons I ſhall offer theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſeriouſly to be thought on.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether if it were juſt for <hi>Luther</hi> to oppoſe himſelf, as it is plain he did, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the profeſſed judgement of all the Churches of the world, upon this ground, that he had diſcovered (as he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believed) ſome truths of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to Gods glory and mans ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it may not be juſt in the like caſe for other <hi>particular Chriſtians</hi> as he was, to hold and publiſh ſome opinions that are directly contrary to what is and hath been generally believed?</p>
               <p>But it may bee ſaid, that the Church now being reformed hath attained that perfection which before it wanted, and therefore it cannot be ſo fit now as it might be then.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to which, I willingly grant that the Church hath attained a greater perfection; but that this perfection is ſuch, as either to exempt it wholly from the power of erring, or that the whole Church, or ſome remarkable part of it, ſuch as is a <hi>Synod</hi> or <hi>Councel</hi> repreſenting
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169709:88"/>it, ſhould ſee more clearly alwayes in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine matters then ſome ſingle Chriſtian, I as readily deny; that which hath been done may be done,
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.8.</note> &amp; the ſpirit (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) bloweth where it liſteth (as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith) even the <hi>Spirit of truth:</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, yea, many times wee may juſtly think (if we conſider, beſides the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in determining, the policies and worldly intereſts that in Synods are often acted) diſcovering that to the world by the means of one ſingle perſon, which it conceals from theſe; and that doubtleſs, as well to make it ſelfe the more obvious to be taken notice of in the weakneſſe of the inſtrument, as thereby to give a check to thoſe affections which in Synods often bearing ſway, make them juſtly incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this honour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether it be not very reaſonable to imagine, conſidering that great heap of corruptions and errours, which is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged generally by all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to have been ſetled in the Church when <hi>Luther</hi> firſt attempted a reformation, and which had been the work of the <hi>ſpirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> (beginning to act in the <hi>Apoſtles dayes</hi>) for many ages ſucceſſively down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.3.</note> to bring up to that height and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169709:89"/>perfection they were then at; whether (I ſay) this being conſidered, it be not reaſonable to imagine, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that was diſcovered by him, or his aſſiſtants of that time, there may be ſome groſs errours (though not ſo directly and neceſsarily hinderances of ſalvation as ſome of thoſe by them detected) left ſtill remaining behind, which others by the aſſiſtance of the ſame ſpirit which they had, may helpe to manifeſt to the world: the reaſonableneſs of which ſuppoſall may be inferr'd from theſe following grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it ſeems not probable, that the bottome of ſuch a corruption which had been ſo long a gathering and was ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted, ſhould be all at once of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or in one age fully diſcovered, ſo long as the perſons that were inſtruments of making this diſcovery though they are juſtly to be accounted men of eminent ability and proportionable piety, yet are confeſt to be ſuch, as had no immediate revelation, nor infallible aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As in bodily diſtempers when a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe hath been long rooted, and hath diffuſed its malignity through all the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169709:89"/>parts and humours of the body, a through cure is neither poſſible nor ſafe, on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be attempted, leſt ſuch a remedy prove worſe then the diſeaſe: ſo in this caſe, the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> having been then ſo deeply and univerſally affected with corruptious in a manner, through all parts of Religion, we may conceit that a through cure could not without endangering of its vitals, on a ſudden be attempted; to have gone about to have purged out all at once and together, where ſo many things were unſound, might have given ſome occaſion to thinke, that there could be nothing good or ſound remaining, if this diſcovery had been then improved into ſuch a full light, it might (conſidering the groſſe dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe men had ſo long lived in) rather have blinded then helpt them in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual eye-ſight; that is, rather have made them <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> then <hi>Reformiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. God himſelf does ordinarily by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees proceed in his works to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and even in diſcoveries of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Thus at firſt he revealed himſelf, and the manner of his worſhip, onely ſomewhat generally and obſcurely to the firſt ages, and inhabitants of the world;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169709:90"/>after that, ſomewhat more diſtinctly, and particularly to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and yet after this, far more fully and perfectly to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> his ſeed, by <hi>Moſes:</hi> all which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoveries were yet (in reſpect of that perfect model exhibited in the Goſpel) but <hi>rudiments,
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.3.</note> or elements of the world,</hi> as they are called: and for the Goſpel, which is the only full and perfect light in this kinde. There was firſt <hi>John Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſt</hi> as the morning ſtar, or dawning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sun-riſing ſent to make way for it, by preparing mens mindes through his more imperfect doctrine inſtilled into them, for the admiſſion of this great and ſplendent light; the ſubſtance whereof though it was fully delivered by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his preaching, yet we finde, even thoſe to whom the chief care of publiſhing it to others was committed by him, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Apostles,</hi> through the prepoſſeſſion that other opinions they had been bred up in had taken of them, could not by Chriſts ſo teaching it, ſufficiently in all things apprehend it: perſiſting in the belief and practiſe of ſome things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what they had received from him, till by ſome other more particular means they were convinc't to the contrary; and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169709:90"/>ſo we finde the <hi>Jews</hi> that at firſt became Chriſtians, not only ſtill in love with the practiſe of many <hi>Moſaick ceremonies,</hi> all which were of right declared to be void by the doctrine and death of Chriſt; but even ſtil in a manner permitted by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> therein: who could not but well conſider what power prepoſſeſſion muſt needs have in them, from that whereof they had had experience in themſelves; and therefore upon this ground, as they did not urge their authority ſo far, as to require an abſolute and univerſal confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of others in all things, to what they themſelves taught and held: ſo they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thoſe converted <hi>Jewes</hi> in theſe things to diſſent from them,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.15.</note> till God in time might by ſome other means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the unneceſſarineſſe and unprofitableneſſe of the ſaid ceremonies: which ſhortly after he did moſt fully, in ſuffering the <hi>Jewes Temple</hi> (the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the celebrating that ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious worſhip in) to be deſtroyed, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> themſelves to be excluded out of that Countrey that he had given them, and ſo their government to be diſſolved. Now this I ſay, having b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n Gods method heretofore, thus by degrees and parcels
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169709:91"/>to reveal his truth, and bring men into a belief and ſubmiſsion to it; why ſhould it not be reaſonable to conceive that he might do ſo at the time of the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation? that is, communicate ſuch a proportion of truth to the world then, as was ſimply neceſſary, and which the conſtitution of that time would admit: but leave ſtill ſome more for others in after times to finde out? and therefore ſure the going about to ſtifle or hinder all ſuch productions of others in this kinde, as go beyond the latitude of that diſcovery that was then made; though it may ſometimes poſsibly keep out er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, yet it may as certainly be a bar to truth, if ever God offer it (as I know not but he may and hath) by the pains of ſome ſingle perſon to make it appear to the world; and ſo ſuch courſe is to be interpreted a reſiſting of his Spirit, and ſo far, <hi>a fighting against God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether it is not probable, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the great and general ſinfulneſſe of Chriſtians, even of thoſe that are called <hi>Reformiſts</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> (the far greater part whereof every where, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably and reſolvedly allow themſelves in the violation of many known <hi>lawes of

                  <note place="margin">John 7.17.14.21. 2 Theſ. 2.11</note> And withall conſidering that ordinary diſpenſation, which the <hi>Scripture</hi> tels us God is wont to uſe, either in reference to a clearer diſcovery of truth, or giving men up to errour; whether theſe things being conſidered it be not probable, that ſome errour, or errours, either are, or have been <hi>publickly</hi> and <hi>authoritatively</hi> maintain'd, which are to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both as a root or ſpring of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and <hi>epidemical</hi> ſinfulneſs; and alſo in part as a puniſhment of it? Who does not ſee, that for ſuch opinions as are any way favourable to the fleſh, and mens ſenſual eaſe and enjoyments, if there be but any little ſeeming pretenſe from <hi>Scripture</hi> to ground them on its authoritie? how men are moſt generally ready and willing to believe them? and who may not but know, that conſidering the great purity and declar'd ſeveritie of God in this kind, God often uſes to deliver up ſuch perſons to the power of ſuch opinions, to believe them as divine <hi>Oracles of Truth,</hi> when indeed they are nothing but lies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men? Upon all which
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:169709:92"/>grounds, I conceive it altogether a thing unreaſonable which hath of late been much practiſed, and which ſome ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of; namely the ſtopping ſuch books, or opinions, from coming abroad, or having the favour to be publickly known or conſidered, as are preſumed to to be againſt ſome things long and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received.</p>
               <p>Now to return to the conſideration of that which we laſt ſpoke of; namely the ſtrength of theſe <hi>ſtrong holds</hi> formerly mentioned: the reaſonings I mean which the <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>wiſdome</hi> of great ones heretofore ſuggeſted to them, whereby to maintain their ſtanding out againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the profeſsion of his doctrine; I ſhall now briefly ſhew you, how theſe forts were demoliſht, how their reaſons were in great part ſilenced and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and that was by no other way, but by the uſe and power of thoſe weapons formerly ſpoke of. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers then, that had the managing of the ſaid weapons, did not deny what theſe oppoſers affirm'd, either as relating to the upholding the credit of their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, or towards the abating the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of that which they were to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169709:92"/>to; that is, they did not denie, but that thoſe Religions of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were ancient, and generally received, and that men of great dignity and place were Patrons and profeſſors of them; nor that they had had outward proſperitie joyn'd with them: Neither did they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that this Religion of <hi>Chriſts</hi> was then new; not that it was publiſht and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by mean perſons, and accompanied with the rage and enmity of the world: That the Author of it did indeed ſuffer thoſe vile evils by them objected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out avenging himſelf, which made him ſeem ſo deſpicable a perſon in the eyes of the world, and that he hath taught ſuch kind of ſufferings (having the like meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and humility to what he expreſt, joyn'd to them) to be the only road that leads to eternal happineſſe, and glory.</p>
               <p>They did (I ſay) deny none of theſe things, neither did they go about by any the like prudential conſiderations to commend the doctrine which they held forth, and ſo to maintain the ſide that they were of: which would have been in effect, only to make the matter alike diſputable on either ſide, ſo that men ſhould not have known, where to have
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169709:93"/>ſetled; but they did infallibly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly ſhew that all thoſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted for truths that were object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that which the alledgers of them la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to infer thence, namely the worth and authority of thoſe Religions of their own they ſtood for, and the falſhood and unworthineſſe of that which hereupon they oppos'd could no way be inferr'd; yea, they did moſt plainly and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively prove, that notwithſtanding all the ſeeming advantages of the one ſide, and diſadvantages on the other; the one, that is, thoſe <hi>Paganiſh</hi> religions were lies and inventions of the Devil; and that the other, namely this of Chriſts, was a certain and infallible truth deriv'd from God, and neceſſarily by all to be aſſented and ſubmitted unto.</p>
               <p>Both theſe things (I ſay) they did moſt evidently prove and manifeſt by the uſe of the former weapons; for who muſt not but grant, that that which God himſelf diſowns and condemns and ſets himſelf againſt, what ever other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations there may ſeem to be for the commendation of it, is falſe and impious, and deſervedly to be rejected? as on the contrary, that which he owns and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves

                  </hi> in the ſight of all the nations, in thoſe ſtupendious <hi>miracles</hi> that were acted by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> thoſe <hi>ſignes, and wonders, and mighty deeds</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) by thoſe he did abundantly declare (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then was poſſible by any humane ſtrength or eloquence) even as if hee had immediately in ſome audible voice ſpoken from heaven, that hee was the true au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour and approver of that doctrine the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> publiſht; and contrarily the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demner of that which they oppoſed; by thoſe he declared that who ever ſhould ſtand out, and reſiſt the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> meſſage in this kind, thus by him born witneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they ſhould therein not ſo much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves againſt them, as againſt him himſelf, who thus declared that hee ſent them.</p>
               <p>'Tis true; ſome impoſtors might through the aſſiſtance of the devil do ſometimes ſome ſuch ſtrange feats as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169709:94"/>might raiſe admiration in the beholders; and work ſome eſpecially of the weaker ſort to give credit to them, in believing ſuch lies as they broacht; but beſides that none of theſe were any true miracles, they were ordinarily ſuch as onely ſerved to beget admiration, not to derive any true profit to thoſe that were partakers of them: there was no <hi>healing of the lame,</hi> or <hi>giving ſight to the blinde,</hi> or <hi>raiſing of the dead;</hi> and further the perſons that were actors of them were ordinarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous for ſome kind of wickedneſſe or other; and did theſe things for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves a name, and to gain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by worldly profits and advantages to themſelves. But here in theſe miracles that were acted by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> it was farre otherwiſe: they were truly what they appeared to be: things beyond the Sphere of nature or any created power; not only admirable in themſelves, but the benefit thereof was as evident: and for the perſons the Actors of them, though therein they manifeſted a greater majeſty and power to be accompanying them, then that which any, or all the Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of the world had; namely, ſuch as was truly divine and of Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169709:94"/>impreſſe, yet ſo farre were they from priding themſelves herein, or arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating and ſeeking any honour or profit hereby to themſelves, that they neglected not the meaneſt employments whereby they might be helpfull to others how low ſoever in the world: yea, they did not forbeare, but ſtill made uſe of theſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary mean callings wherein they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly lived; as <hi>fiſhing</hi> and <hi>tent-making,</hi> thereby to provide neceſſaries for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; by which means, as they in part ſhewed, thoſe divine qualities which they commended to others, of <hi>charity,</hi> and <hi>humility,</hi> and <hi>contempt of the world,</hi> and withal the neceſsity and poſſibility of them; ſo they did further by their zeal in propagating that truth which they had publiſht (being ſufficiently conſcious to themſelves of the want of worldly aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or humane learning and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) when they knew before hand, that bonds and impriſonments abode them; that perſecutions and miſeries were all the rewards they were like to expect from the world; by theſe (I ſay) they did ſufficiently declare that it was not the power of fleſh, but a power mightier then any the world had, even
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169709:95"/>the immediate power of God and his Spirit that thus carried them on.</p>
               <p>And ſo we ſee, they were every way mighty for the pulling down of theſe <hi>ſtrong holds:</hi> mighty <hi>through God;</hi> it was not an earthly worldly mightines, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in them, ſuch as it muſt needs have been, if either they had gone about with eloquence and learned diſcourſes, or with the concurrent aſſiſtance of ſome great and powerfull perſons in the world to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to what they taught: but a mightines far above theſe; ſuch as was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately derived to them from Heaven, and could not but appear to be ſuch to all that were willing to obſerve the workings of it, or would not wilfully ſhut their eyes againſt it. This was that might or power of God, which going along with them in their preaching made the <hi>Goſpel</hi> they preacht (though ſtill it was with ſome, namely, ſuch as wilfully hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and oppoſed themſelves, as <hi>fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>) to appear to thoſe that were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to know the truth (as indeed it was) <hi>the wiſdome of God and the power of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the effects of this mightineſſe on others was quickly ſeen in the world; thoſe ancient religions, or rather ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions

               </p>
               <p>'Tis true; the Apoſtle ſayes of his time and ſo we may conceive it was in the times immediately following, and will be proportionably true of all times:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26.</note> 
                  <hi>not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe men after the fleſh, not many migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not many noble are called,</hi> that is, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, ſo as to relinquiſh, or come out (being wrought thereunto by the force of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preaching and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons that accompanied it) of their <hi>holds,</hi> and bring all their high reaſonings and thoughts in ſubjection unto <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But the reaſon of this is not to be conceived either any antecedent decree of Gods hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them, or denying them that power of giving obedience to the preaching of the Goſpel which hee had afforded to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for as the ſalvation offered in the Goſpel is called <hi>a common ſalvation;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jud. 3.</note> ſo all without diſtinction, of high, or low, rich or poor, were at firſt and ſtill are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently invited to come in, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it: the promiſe runs in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <hi>whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi>

               <p>This then is not (I ſay) to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the reaſon, why not many of theſe ranks <hi>are called,</hi> that is, effectually brought in, in obedience unto <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is the reaſon hereof ſimply to be conceived the ſtrength of theſe <hi>ſtrong holds</hi> or reaſonings, wherewith ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons above others are wont to fortifie themſelves; as if indeed they were too ſtrong to be battered and demoliſhed by the force of thoſe weapons that were uſed againſt them; for ſome ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, though not proportionable to the great number of others, were daily brought in, and ſubmitted themſelves as captives unto <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſuch in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times were <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea a great
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169709:97"/>Counſellor,</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus a Centurion,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius a Philoſopher,</hi> and the <hi>great Chamberlain of the Queen of Ethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Zenas learned in Law,</hi> and <hi>Luke lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Phyſick,</hi> and <hi>Publius the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of an Iland:</hi> And ſo hereby it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appears, that there was a vigour in thoſe weapons, for truely pulling down of theſe Holds, that is, ſilencing and vanquiſhing all ſuch reaſonings of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> as the condition of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, namely their <hi>learning,</hi> or <hi>worldly wiſdom,</hi> or <hi>high dignities</hi> were apt to ſuggeſt to them. So that neither of theſe, neither any antecedent decree of Gods, nor any impregnable ſtrength of the fore-mentioned Holds is to be conceived the true cauſe of the ſtanding out of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and why not <hi>many mighty,</hi> &amp;c. were called.</p>
               <p>But the true reaſon hereof is this, that doctrine they were perſwaded unto, though it promiſed many excellent things hereafter, yet it required much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity and exactneſſe of living at preſent for coming to the enjoyment of them: A ſubmiſsion, after the patern of the firſt Authour of it, to the cauſeleſs reproaches and injuries of the world, and a conſtant
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169709:98"/>continued practice of the exerciſe of godlineſſe, righteouſneſs, and ſobriety, and ſo a ſlight care and eſteem of thoſe things which are of ſo high an account in the world: And beſides, they could not but ſee that the very outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and owning of this doctrine, that then ſo every where was ſpoke againſt, and perſecuted would expoſe them to the loſſe, not onely of that honour and repute which they had above others, but alſo of that ſafety and outward proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they enjoyed in the world.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe conſiderations it was, that the moſt of theſe perſons being willing admirers, and lovers of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that dignity, and priviledges, and eſteem they enjoyed in it, were not willing to ſubmit to the power and authority of him that called them: they would not be perſwaded, though they were perſwaded, that is, though they had that which was ſufficient enough to perſwade and convince them that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> doctrine was from heaven, and that the certain way to come thither would be for them to profeſs and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it; yet in regard this could not bee done without parting with thoſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169709:98"/>great advantages and eaſe and priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they enjoyed in the world, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelves ſubject to the contrary evils, and hazards from it; they reſolved out of their ſetled love to theſe, ſtill to remain in the condition they were in, rather then make any ſuch exchange.</p>
               <p>If they might have had hopes allowed them of enjoying the happineſs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hereafter together with thoſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and emoluments they were at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſt of; or if the doctrine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them might have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by them without incurring any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards or inconveniences in this reſpect, they would readily have come in and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: but ſeeing that great good that was promiſed in it could not bee come at but upon ſuch harſh and unpleaſant tearms; farewell all; they will put all to a venture rather then ſo entertain it.</p>
               <p>Thus (I ſay) it may appear; that the true cauſe why <hi>not many noble, not many wiſe according to the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are called,</hi> that is, wrought to a ſubmiſſion to the Goſpel by the preaching and power of it, is onely a <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>obſtinate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them, not to be perſwaded;</hi> not to admit or ſubmit unto that as truth (how
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:169709:99"/>ever proved, and enforced) which is like to be ſo prejudiciall to them in their worldly intereſts: and this obſtinacie is to be looked upon, as occaſioned by their carnall reaſonings before named, and the grounds of them, namely their outward worldly dignities and high places, &amp;c. But not as certainly cauſed thereby: for then this effect would have been wrought in all others of the like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas diverſe (as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before) were notwithſtanding the ſtrength of them brought into a willing ſubmiſſion to the Goſpel, and ſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by at once manifeſted the power of thoſe weapons for the ſubduing of all ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, and tacitly accuſed or upbraided others to have in <hi>them</hi> an inordinate love of the world, which was to bee lookt upon as the ſole cauſe of their ſtanding out and oppoſition in this kinde.</p>
               <p>Thus far wee have ſpoke of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that had theſe <hi>ſtrong holds,</hi> that is, ſome more then ordinary carnall reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which they uſed for ſtrengthning themſelves in their ſtanding out and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as they had rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their times, when yet wholly they were unconverted to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169709:99"/>ſo much as an outward profeſſion of Chriſtian religion.</p>
               <p>It remains now, that I ſpeak of ſuch perſons, with relation to our times, as they are amongſt us outward profeſſours; or ſuch as have a form of religion, but for the moſt part deny the power of it, living in many known violations of the <hi>lawes of Chriſt;</hi> as many great, and rich and learned men do: which ſo long as they do, as they are to be conceived to do it by occaſion of theſe <hi>ſtrong holds:</hi> ſo they are likewiſe to bee reckoned as perſons that are yet in the broad way, that is, in a way quite contrary to that which leads to heaven, and therefore have need as well as the others to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by thoſe weapons that may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due them to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, make them converts and become Chriſtians indeed. But yet I would not have this ſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, as if I conceived, either that all ſuch perſons were onely formall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours and ſtrangers to the power of godlineſs; or that their <hi>learning,</hi> or <hi>riches</hi> or <hi>dignities,</hi> and <hi>great places in the world</hi> were neceſſary hinderances to religion, and the things which certainly do cauſe them to be ſuch as for the moſt part they
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169709:100"/>are: there are (I doubt not, and ſo I hope ſtill will be) ſome ſuch as wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore menntioned in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, <hi>learned men</hi> and <hi>Governours,</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours</hi> that are of <hi>Chriſts</hi> true retinue; and being ſo, their <hi>learning, wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. are ſo farre from hindering them, that thereby they are enabled to bee more fruitfull in good works; to do God more honour and men amongſt whom they live more good then others that want them. The thing that we intend, is, that the greateſt part of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is ordinarily averſe to the life of religion or <hi>power of godlineſſe,</hi> and that is thoſe reaſonings chiefly which ſuch <hi>learning</hi> or <hi>greatneſſe</hi> ſuggeſts to them, that are the cauſe, or rather occaſion of ſuch averſeneſs.</p>
               <p>The former part hath been in effect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved from that of the <hi>Apoſtle, Not many noble,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe words I conceive, being to have a proportionable extent to all times, though they were immediately ſpoke of that time of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond part is that which is proper now to be ſpoke of; namely concerning the reaſonings wherwith ſuch perſons for
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:169709:100"/>tifie themſelves againſt ſubmiſſion to the <hi>power of godlineſſe:</hi> and wee may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them ſome way proportionable and like to thoſe reaſonings before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of the <hi>Heathen Gentiles,</hi> that is:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as they uſe to uphold the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of that empty formality, or liveleſſe profeſsion of religion wherein they at preſent live, and which they are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to relinquiſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as ſerve to aſperſe that way of ſtrict and univerſall holineſſe and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, they are exhorted, and laboured to be brought unto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Touching the former; by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty formality, and liveleſs profeſſion of ſuch, I mean nothing elſe but their living in the conſtant and allowed violation of the known <hi>laws of Chriſt,</hi> promulgated in the Goſpel, ſuch (as to omit other more ſcandalous ſins) are thoſe courſes of <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>prodigality,</hi> that many great ones are tainted with; ſpending their large eſtates in gorgeous apparel, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous feaſting and entertainment, and a great part of their time and means in dicing and carding, and other wayes of voluptuouſneſſe; as if they were placed here in the world, as the <hi>Leviathan in the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:169709:101"/>Sea, only to take their paſtime therein:</hi> and ſuch are thoſe wayes of <hi>vain and curious ſpeculations,</hi> and <hi>diſputes</hi> and <hi>exerciſes of wit,</hi> about curious perplexing and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable queſtions, ſuch as no way ſerve, but are rather hindrances <hi>unto Godlineſſe;</hi> in which many learned perſons wholly in a manner imploy themſelves, without bending their ſtudies, as they may and ought, to advance the power of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in themſelves and others: and laſtly, ſuch are thoſe <hi>courſes of worldlineſſe, of heaping and hoarding up treaſures for themſelves, and their heirs,</hi> without any proportionable laying them out in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, or publike good works for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God, and benefit of others; which is the diſeaſe of many rich ones in the world.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Holds</hi> or reaſonings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſuch perſons fortifie themſelves herein, are ſomewhat of a like nature with thoſe before alledged: as</p>
               <p n="1">1. A kinde of <hi>Antiquity</hi> and preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of time for the practiſing of them: they are things that have been alwayes uſed; this hath ſtill been the faſhion of the <hi>Gentry and Gallantry</hi> of the time, think they that are, or deſire to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:169709:101"/>for ſuch: and Schollers have alwayes thus exerciſed their wits and expreſt their learning, and thereby attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed honour above the vulgar; think thoſe that are, or affect to be eminent in this way: and this skill hath been the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of men enjoying or attaining great eſtates in the world; thus to preſerve them to themſelves and theirs, think they that are willing to take the ſame courſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A kinde of <hi>univerſality:</hi> theſe are faſhions that are every where and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uſed, and ſo have the concurring approbation of all ſuch as ſo conform to them for the warranting of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A kinde alſo of <hi>authority:</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that do thus are not mean and ſimple or vulgar perſons, but as their condition ſpeaks them, of the greateſt note and eminency in the world, and ordinarily moſt reputed of for wiſdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p>And to all theſe, it may be, they may adde the experience they have had of Gods bleſsing them in theſe courſes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying, it may be, an uninterrupted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, and not conflicting with thoſe difficulties that other perſons of a ſtricter
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:169709:102"/>converſation in this kinde often meet with.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For that way of punctual and exact holineſſe commended in the word; ſuch as is to be reputed contrary to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned and many other corruptions: conſiſting <hi>in walking after the ſpirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.8.15. Col. 3.2. Phil. 3.20. 1 Cor. 10.31 1 Tim. 6.18.</note> and <hi>mortifying the deeds of the fleſh, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our mindes and meditations in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and <hi>doing all to the glory of God,</hi> and <hi>being rich in good works,</hi> in brief, ſuch as conſiſts in a deliberate and exact doing the will of God in every thing; and for that purpoſe, a daily conſulting with his word, and making uſe of thoſe helps of <hi>prayer, meditation, and Chriſtian conferences,</hi> commended to us therein, as neceſſary for that end. This way (I ſay) is that which ſuch perſons will be ready to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe and calumniate, at leaſt in thoſe who ſeem to be frequenters of it, or to draw others thereunto, in the like manner as the unconverted <hi>Heathen</hi> did hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>outward</hi> profeſſion of Chriſtian religion, that is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, as ſome <hi>new device,</hi> invented by ſome melancholy or pragmaticall and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-buſie or preciſe perſons; ſuch as trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves with more then becomes

               <p>Secondly, as a way if at all obſerved yet only in a manner by <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>obſcure perſons,</hi> ſuch as do not or cannot well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the extent of their priviledges and <hi>Chriſtian liberty</hi> in this kind; and therefore it cannot but be very unfit for perſons of ſuch quality as they are, to take them herein for their examples: If either be to conforme to other, it were fit that theſe latter that are ſo farre below them come up to them, and not they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to theſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as a way moſt <hi>unpleaſing and uncomfortable,</hi> for men wholly to limit themſelves to the <hi>law of God;</hi> to ſpeak or think or do nothing but what it requires or allowes; to ſpend a great part of their time in prayers, and meditations, and Chriſtian diſcourſes out of the word for edifying themſelves in godlineſſe; to lay out their means which ſhould make them and their Heirs live in honour and eſteem in the world, upon ſtrangers or ſuch as they have no particular obligation to:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169709:103"/>theſe are things wherein as a great part of Religion conſiſts; So they are ordinarily lookt upon by ſuch perſons as very harſh and unpleaſant courſes, and ſuch as are very unſuitable with thoſe ends of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying worldly repute and profit and pleaſures which they have propoſed to themſelves, and therefore are ſo farre the more oppoſite to them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, there are ſome of the <hi>lawes of Chriſt,</hi> and which theſe perſons ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently know to be ſuch; yet if we may judge (as I know not but we may) by their avowed &amp; deliberate practice in this kind, are lookt upon by them, as things below them, that is, as diſgracefull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy for them to obſerve; namely, thoſe publiſhed touching the <hi>abſtaining from al revenge and conteſting with others,</hi> inſtead where of is commended to us <hi>praying and bleſſing,

                  </gap>xample, namely, our bleſſed <hi>Saviour:</hi> Theſe are thoſe <hi>ſtrong holds</hi> whereby ſuch perſons come to be fortified in their ſins, making them reſolutely go on al their dayes in a wilfull breach of ſome or more of the known <hi>lawes of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to all theſe may bee added that which is indeed the main ſtrength and ſupporter of all theſe reaſonings in them, and of that careleſneſſe or remiſneſſe in obſerving the <hi>lawes of Christ</hi> which flowes from thence, that is, a <hi>ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward perſwaſion derived to them, from ſome common but unſound doctrine, namely, touching the unneceſſarineſſe of ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and univerſall exact walking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming our ſelves to the word: that men may be ſaved and come to Heaven ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily without it; that to relie on the merits of Chriſt; to apprehend and apply his righteouſneſſe to our ſelves, (which is that formality of juſtifying faith which ſome teach, and which ſurely for the nature of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169709:104"/>the thing may be exhibited in the laſt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and that <hi>by thoſe</hi> that <hi>for all the time before have conſtantly neglected the doing of the forementioned duties</hi>) that this is ſufficient for <hi>ſecuring a man of ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that common great Engine or Fortreſs whereby ſuch perſons and all others in a manner that are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of it, become impregnable in their holds; their ſubduing being in a ſort im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and ſo they themſelves in this reſpect in a more deſperate condition then thoſe of the ancient <hi>Gentiles the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> had to deal with; ſo long as it remains un-demoliſht in them. And therefore in the firſt place, for pulling down all the <hi>Strong holds</hi> before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, the attempt muſt bee made here againſt this which pretends to bee built upon, and have for its ground the word it ſelf: and that muſt be by ſhewing that which the <hi>Scripture</hi> will eaſily enable us unto, as every where in a manner affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it;
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.14.</note> Namely that <hi>without holineſſe</hi> which is expreſt elſe where by <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commandements of God,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6.15.</note> there is no ſeeing of God to bee expected: that <hi>hearing of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:169709:104"/>Chriſts words without doing of them, makes a man like to a fooliſh builder,</hi> and is a <hi>deceiving of himſelf:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 7.26. Jam. 1.22. Rom. 2.7.</note> that <hi>life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality is onely aſſured by the Apoſtle, to thoſe that by patient continuance in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing wait for it:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.9.</note> That hee that wants the divine Graces <hi>of Godlineſſe,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.9.</note> tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, charity,</hi> and the reſt reckoned up by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> (what ever knowledge he otherwiſe have) is <hi>blinde,

               <p>Now then; If theſe things can be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably thought to bee included in that <hi>reliance or faith,</hi> which men are taught and are generally ſo willing to build their main hopes upon; or if they bee indeed ſuch things as can bee tranſacted by men in their laſt ſickneſſe: if it can with any truth or reaſon be ſaid, that hee who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life and health, hath conformed himſelf more to the courſes of the world, then to the righteous and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Lawes of Chriſt,</hi> having lived in one, or mo ſuch wayes as are directly contrary

                  </gap>ſſe they have been guilty of in their life time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their doing the will of God: but if theſe things be (as ſure they are, if men will not wilfully ſhut their eyes) to be reputed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, things altogether ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and inconſiſtent to imagine; namely, that he that hath conſtantly neglected the lawes of God in his life time, is one that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169709:105"/>hath <hi>lived as a new creature and done the will of God,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe he mournes for his ſins at laſt, and applies <hi>Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi> to himſelf; then certainly we may conclude that fort to be of the devils and not of Gods ſetting up: and ſo (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it proves) that which is rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the hardning of men to their deſtruction, then any way for the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their comfort and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Conſider therefore I beſeech you aright of this matter, and let no practice or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion how common or generally received ſoever draw you away to think or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelves of that which is ſo oppoſite to the plain and expreſs words of <hi>Scripture;</hi> eſpecially in a matter of this moment, wherein the ſalvation of your ſouls is ſo neerly and certainly concerned. Thus this outward common fort being demoliſht, there will be an eaſier acceſſe to thoſe other more inward and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>forts</hi> before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Indeed a through demoliſhing of this out of mens minds (which is onely poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be done by ſoundly demonſtrating out of the word the groundleſneſſe of it, and ſo planting the contrary perſwaſion in men; namely, that there is no hopes of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:169709:106"/>coming to Heaven, but by conſtant and univerſall doing the will of God) would be if it were accompanied with anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that is, an exemplary carriage of thoſe who ſet about it; effectuall alſo for the pulling down together therewith all theſe other particular and indeed weaker holds which we have before mentioned: But ſo long as this is upheld, and ſecretly ſupported (as indeed it is) with the props of ſome <hi>unſound, and corrupt opinions</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believed and maintained; and ſo long as we want the uſe of that wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon amongſt us of <hi>excommunication,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> formerly bequeathed to his Church, and which wee have before ſhowne to be ſo many wayes uſefull and neceſſary for it: we can have no great hopes by any other means or weapons that can be made uſe of ſo farre to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail as to bring in any proportionable number of thoſe great multitudes that make profeſſion of, and have given their names to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to become his reall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and ſervants; by giving him their hearts, and ſubjecting all their thoughts and wayes in obedience to him.</p>
               <p>But yet ſtill there is ſomewhat that is poſſible for us to do; I mean for thoſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169709:106"/>that are right Chriſtian ſouldiers indeed towards the pulling down of the former <hi>holds;</hi> the ſilencing and confuting all the reaſonings of theſe great ones of the world againſt their ſubmitting themſelves throughly to the <hi>lawes of Chriſt</hi> and ſo bringing in one or other, as a captive to him.</p>
               <p>God hath planted ſo much light in the minds of theſe perſons (as he hath indeed in the minds of all others as they are men) as cannot but enable them to approve, and even tacitly admire vertue in others, eſpecially when it is ſingular and eminent; and beſides,</p>
               <p>Such perſons, like as all others, that make but an outward profeſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his religion, yet hereby at leaſt implicitly acknowledge themſelves to be under his government, and ſo bound to pay ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and obedience to his righteous laws, which being ſo</p>
               <p>Firſt it may eaſily be repreſented to them hence, that all ſuch pleas as are made from <hi>antiquity</hi> or <hi>univerſality</hi> or <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of men, for going on in, or practiſing ſuch courſes as are not conſonant to thoſe righteous <hi>lawes</hi> of his publiſht in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, are all vain and groundleſſe; for</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:169709:107"/>
               <p>Can any man profeſſe himſelf a ſervant of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (as all profeſſing Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion do) and in the mean time not bind himſelf punctually to what he requires of him; but conforme to what the great men or generality of the world practiſe; and not hereupon plainly ſee, that in ſo doing, he is not indeed what he profeſſes, that is, a true but onely a mock ſervant, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince we are told, what reaſon it ſelfe cannot but confirme;
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.16.</note> that <hi>his ſervants we are, whom we obey.</hi> Can any man be ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable as to think that the calling himſelf a ſervant to another, or him maſter, will be ſufficient to make that perſon owne him for ſuch; if ſo be he do not that which he appoints, and requires of him, but what others that are indeed his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies rather draw him unto?</p>
               <p>Secondly, does not this very doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> (which ſuch profeſſe) tell them and all others, that God hideth <hi>from the wiſe and prudent that which he revealeth to babes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 11.25. Luk. 16.15. 1 Joh. 5.16. Matt. 7.14. Luk. 12.32.</note> that <hi>that which is of high account with men, is abominable in the ſight of God:</hi> that <hi>the whole world lies in wickedneſſe:</hi> that <hi>the way is narrow, and the gate ſtrait, and the flock little that belongs to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And may they not hence then rather
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169709:107"/>ſuſpect and conclude themſelves to bee out of that way, and none of that flock, becauſe their courſes are ſo generally owned, and practiſed, and countenanced by the moſt and greateſt: then upon theſe grounds preſume that they are in the one, or belonging to the other, and ſo draw thence any comfort, or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to themſelves?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Upon the former grounds it may be further made appear to ſuch perſons, that all thoſe other <hi>exceptions</hi> of theirs made either againſt the perſons of thoſe that limit themſelves (or are thought to do ſo) to a ſtrict and univerſall walking with God; as being mean many times and inconſiderable in other reſpects; or againſt the way of thus walking it ſelf, as being melancholy, and unpleaſing to the fleſh, and which in ſome of the <hi>tracks</hi> of it ſeems diſhonourable for men of <hi>gallantry</hi> to limit themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that all ſuch are not onely vain, but in great part wicked and blaſphemous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Christ,</hi> whoſe ſervants ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themſelves to be, and therefore the practiſe grounded thereon cannot but bee certainly deſtructive and damnable: for what can, or ought the meanneſſe of the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169709:108"/>perſons, eſpecially amongſt Chriſtians detract from the credit of the way they go on in; if it bee indeed, that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath preſcribed? does not their thus doing, rather juſtly upbraid the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and madneſſe of ſuch great and wiſe perſons, as being ſo great and wiſe in other things, and having the means that they want, to be ſo in theſe, ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be out-done in this kind, and ſo out-witted by ſuch mean perſons, then lay any blemiſh upon that way it ſelf? Was not <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf in his outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and converſation very mean, and deſpicable, one that (as the Prophet ſayes) <hi>had no beauty in him?</hi> and were not his prime retinue ſuch in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition,
<note place="margin">Eſay 52.2. 1 Cor. 9.13.</note> being as the <hi>filth and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring of the world?</hi> And can it then with thoſe that know and beleeve theſe things, be thought any reaſonable ground of exception againſt the ſtrict and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe way of ſerving God (which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is required of us in the Goſpel) that thoſe who do ſo, that is, <hi>Chriſts</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and common followers, are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mean and inconſiderable perſons; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when wee have ſo many <hi>Items</hi> in the word, to minde us of the ordinary

               <p>Further, touching that which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by ſuch perſons concerning the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſantneſſe and harſhneſs of this way, and the diſhonour of practiſing ſome things commended to us therein: How can ſuch things bee objected or imagined by any who profeſſes himſelf a Chriſtian, without ſo far in effectmaking himſelf guilty of contradicting his profeſſion; that is, diſowning and denying him in his heart and practiſe whom by his words and outward carriage he pretends to ſubmit unto as his <hi>Supream Lord</hi> and <hi>Ruler?</hi> Do not we by our very <hi>profeſſing</hi> of the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi> declare to the world, (though wee ſay nothing) that hee is the perſon whom wee have made choiſe of to ſerve; and that we account no way ſo likely or certain, that men are acquainted with or accuſtomed to, to bring men to happineſs and ſalvation as that which he hath commended to us? and will not then the objecting againſt this way, that it is unpleaſant and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and ſo a relinquiſhing of it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:169709:109"/>to conform to it upon ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, be not onely a diſproving and gainſaying of that which we make ſhew of <hi>profeſſing;</hi> but alſo a preferring of thoſe other wayes, which <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> and the courſe of the world enclines us to, above that?</p>
               <p>Beſides, can any way, or courſe of living, howſoever otherwiſe eaſie, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to us it may ſeem to be; bee truly thought fitter or more profitable for us to conform unto then that which he whom we beleeve (according to the Scripture) to be the <hi>wiſdom of God,</hi> and in this reſpect the <hi>image of him that is inviſible</hi> hath commended and preſcribed unto us?

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169709:114"/>fall ſhort of what they thus earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, but alſo hereby that which is truely of more value, and for the better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which they are to bee preſumed to fight, namely their lives; and though they may know alſo that the utmoſt propoſed herein to themſelves, or poſſible to be by this means acquired, being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, is but as a bubble which depends upon a little breath, and is certainly let out and loſt with it; and yet in our <hi>Chriſtian warfare</hi> where the <hi>prize</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be fought for is (and ſo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is acknowledged) moſt certain in it ſelf, and infinitely glorious for the excellency and laſtingneſſe of it; men are generally ſo opinionated, as if the formentioned profeſſion of fighting never really acted, or ſome late ſorrow for neglecting, it when now there wants time to perform it, would bee abundantly ſufficient for gaining the ſaid prize: whence els may wee think is it that the moſt ordinarily content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch faint and ſlight <hi>velitations</hi> in this kind? or to ſpeak more plainly and without a figure, whence is it els, that the generality of Chriſtians allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a ſupine neglect of ſome one or more of <hi>the lawes of Chriſt</hi> promulgated
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169709:114"/>in the goſpel, in the uniform and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued obſerving of which, this kind of fighting truly conſiſts.</p>
            <p>I have no pleaſure to accuſe others in this kind; but yet it is no leſſe eaſy, than truly lamentable to obſerve what ſmall conformity there is betwixt thoſe <hi>lawes of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>lives of Christians:</hi> and, becauſe the opening of a ſoare is to be a preparative to the healing of it, I ſhall (intending now chiefly to contribute my paines and kill for bringing thoſe two neerer together) firſt endeavour to lay open what a diſtance they are at, that is, how great the corruption is of the latter, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>lives of Chriſtians,</hi> by ſetting forth how much the former, to wit, the <hi>lawes of Chriſt</hi> are diſuſed, if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned by thoſe who profeſſe themſelves for ſuch perſons, that is <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the <hi>lawes of Chriſt,</hi> I mean nothing els, but thoſe divine precepts of holineſſe either cleerly deliverd by him, or by thoſe that were certainly acted by his Spirit (having had him ſpeaking in them) the ſacred penmen of holy writ:
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.2.</note> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, though they are very numerous in themſelves, and lie much diſperſed, yet they may I conceive appoſitely be reduced to

            <p>Firſt then for <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> which is that part (as here it is to be taken) of religion which immediatly &amp; directly reſpects God himſelf:
<note place="margin">Lu. 18.1. 1 Theſſ. 5.17.</note> it conſiſts (as wee may conceive from <hi>ſcripture</hi>) in a kind of conſtant and unwearie calling upon God by prayer; and in other exerciſes relating imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to the things of the <hi>kingdome of heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 6.33.</note> the place where God inhabits; as in <hi>ſeeking firſt that place, and the things belonging thereunto;</hi> ſo as not to be truly ſollicitous for any other things here below, and in <hi>ſetting our minds and affections on theſe things;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3.1.2</note> which thing what it imports wee may eaſily know by that care and longing and intention of mind that the ſetting of mens affections on other things is ordinarily accompanied with; and laſtly in <hi>exhorting,

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:169709:115"/>by frequent mutuall and deliberate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences on ſuch matters; all which are required either as parts to make up, or as teſtimonies to expreſs the foreſaid god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs or devotion required in us.</p>
            <p>Now where ſhall we find amongſt the numerous multitudes of <hi>profeſſours</hi> any conſiderable numbers exemplifying ſuch godlineſs in their practice? do not moſt mens words, and actions (though wee cannot otherwiſe ſee into their minds and cloſets) ſufficiently tell us that their minds are not ſet upon heaven or the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and conſequently that they are ſtrangers to ſuch inceſſant communion with God, as our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires we ſhould have with him by prayer? how little are matters of Religion (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for the practick parts of it) made the ſubject of mens diſcourſe? how few are there, that doe commonly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberatly talk of the things of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven? is not ſuch talk in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the temper of moſt companies as unſeaſonable as <hi>ſnow in Summer?</hi> yea is it not ordinarily reputed melancholy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169709:116"/>when the comforts of the world begin to hide themſelves or threaten quite to forſake us?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Touching <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> which is that part of Religion, which in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of it reſpects men, we are to conceive it to conſiſt not only in the doing of thoſe things which by the laws of men are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted righteous; but alſo in thoſe higher ſtrains of perfection which by the divine <hi>laws of Chriſt</hi> are made righteous, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary for us to obſerve; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (to omit others which we ſhall have occaſion under the next head to touch upon) <hi>requiting the evill wiſhes, and words, and deeds of others towards us,
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.44.</note> with a quite contrary carriage, that is, praying for, and bleſſing, and doing good to them:</hi> this being that divine revenge which the Goſpell only allows us,

            <p>Now where ſhall we find any patterns almoſt, repreſenting ſuch righteouſneſs in their practice? who ſees not and is not alſo ready to cry out of that palpable coze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and deceit, and over-reaching that the moſt in all trades and profeſſions or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169709:116"/>make uſe of, whereby the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon dictates of juſtice approved of and authorized with <hi>Heathen Nations</hi> are directly violated? and therefore for thoſe higher doctrines <hi>of loving and bleſſing, and doing good to</hi> and <hi>praying for enemies;</hi> what likelihood can there be of any anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble performance of them? yea, it is plain, that theſe doctrines being literally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood (as they ought to be) and in their true extent, they are as <hi>Utopian Chymaeraes;</hi> ſuch as have no exiſtence in a manner, ſave in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and mens imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; the practice of Chriſtians whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidered in greater or leſſer ſocietie, being quite contrary thereunto: nor only ſo, but which is yet much worſe, that forementioned deportment of our ſelves towards our enemies, ſo plainly required of us by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is in the account of many, who profeſs themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> held as a mean and diſhonourable thing, though the perſon requiring it whom we call <hi>our Lord,</hi> and who was truly the moſt noble perſon that was ever on earth, hath not only gone before us in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice thereof himſelf; but alſo practiſed it to this end, to <hi>leave us an example,</hi>

Concerning the laſt head, <hi>ſobriety;</hi> which is that part of Religion which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly reſpects our ſelves, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, (as here it is to be taken) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt for the generall, in ſuch a moderating of our deſires, and regulating of our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as may fit us for performing the offices of both the former; that is</p>
            <p n="1">1. In this, that <hi>we love not the world, nor the things of it:</hi> all which things St. <hi>John</hi> comprizeth under theſe three heads,

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169709:117"/>preſcribed us in theſe two words, <hi>love not,</hi> and that not only as things moſt righteous in themſelves, and to preſerve in us a regular temper of mind, free from ſuch diſturbances, as the contrary exceſſes are ordinarily accompanied with; but alſo as things requiſite to diſpoſe us towards the performing of thoſe acts of piety and righteouſneſs which we owe towards God and men: it being not poſſible that where the former law and earthly affections take place, theſe ſhould ever be truly performed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As another part of the former <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety</hi> it is required, that our outward carriage be anſwerably tempered with <hi>wiſdom and gravity;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4.8.</note> that <hi>whatſoever things are honeſt, or rather</hi> (as the <hi>Greek</hi> imports) <hi>venerable, we ſhould think upon thoſe and doe them:</hi> and therefore that our <hi>ſpeech be alwaies with grace,

<note place="margin">Eph. 4.29.</note> 
               <hi>that it may be good for the uſe of edifying, and ſuch as may Miniſter grace to the hearers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And where now ſhall we find any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible copies almoſt, that is, any living examples holding forth ſuch <hi>ſobriety</hi> in their practice? may it not be ſaid of one ſort of Chriſtians, that they <hi>are lovers of

               </gap> time therein? and may it not be ſaid of another ſort, <hi>that the God of this world hath blinded their eyes,</hi> namely with the dazeling ſplendour of riches, and worldly profits, preſented in their full (but falſe) glory to them? when as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the danger our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath forewarned us there is in theſe things; and the charge the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath laid upon thoſe that have them to be rich in good works; not only their thoughts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be taken up with a continued ſucceſſive <hi>ſeries</hi> of cares about them, whereby they are often caſt upon unjuſt or ſcandalous courſes for getting or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing them: but alſo their enjoying of them is wholy in a manner ingroſſed to themſelves; to feed their eyes with the pleaſure of beholding them, or their other Iuſts of ambition and ſenſuality, by laying them out ſo as theſe incite them: and may
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169709:118"/>we not think that there is a third ſort of whom it may be ſaid, that that which St. <hi>John</hi> cals the <hi>pride of life</hi> hath taken up the chief room in their hearts? when as ſo many ſigns or rather effects thereof are open to the notice of all; ſuch as <hi>high looks, painted faces, gorgeous apparell, boaſting</hi> (at leaſt obliquely) <hi>of their own worth or parts,</hi> or of that which is not truly their own, <hi>genus &amp; proaves,</hi> the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or it may be only the wealth and greatneſs of their Anceſtours: things all utterly inconſiſtent with that humility which our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath placed as the firſt round in that ladder whereby we are to climb to heaven; and doe not theſe three ſorts (to ſay nothing of thoſe other brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this <hi>ſobriety,</hi> conſiſting in vain talking and fooliſh jeaſting, ſo common with moſt perſons, as drunkards, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not ſo diſtinctly comprized un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe heads) make up every where with us as well as Papiſts, the far greateſt number of Chriſtians, even of thoſe which are the knowing and civill part of them?</p>
            <p>By all which it may appear, that thoſe <hi>lawes of Chriſt,</hi> (or rules of life) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed us in the goſpel, however known
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169709:119"/>and acknowledged for ſuch, are not indeed (hardly by any that ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them) looked upon and accounted as <hi>binding lawes,</hi> that is, ſo binding as that heaven the glorious <hi>prize</hi> held forth to us therein cannot poſſibly be come at but by a conſtant and impartiall obſerving of them: Men hereby (I conceive) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and that more really than they could well otherwiſe by their words, that they think a bare knowledge or <hi>profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of theſe <hi>lawes</hi> never actuated into ſuch an obſervance, nor indeed ever truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſo is all that is <hi>indiſpenſably</hi> required of them in reference to that place, and ſo that heaven may be won by thoſe that onely profeſſe to fight for it, without really doing ſo.</p>
            <p>Now one principall aim of the former diſcourſe is to work men off this pleaſing but pernicious perſwaſion; to ſhow, that which I ſhall now more largely inſiſt on and confirm, namely, that <hi>theſe lawes of Chriſt</hi> were given to another end than onely to be known or talked of; <hi>that</hi> the <hi>glorious reward</hi> of eternall life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and propoſed to the world by him (though it infinitely exceed for the true worth of it, the utmoſt imaginable extent
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169709:119"/>of our obedience; ſo that wee could not be ſaid upon a ſuppoſall of our abſolute freedom from ſin and continued walking in gods commandements all our dayes, properly to merit it; yet) cannot be come at but in that <hi>narrow way</hi> which he hath limited: <hi>that</hi> wee muſt come up to <hi>Chriſts own tearmes</hi> if wee will indeed purchaſe this <hi>rich pearl,</hi> and theſe tearmes are no other but the obſerving of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>lawes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 11.29.</note> or as our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf ſpeakes, the <hi>taking of his yoke upon us</hi> (his <hi>eaſy yoke,</hi> as he calls it, as beeing by him lightned of thoſe numerous and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile ceremonies which made it formerly lie ſo heavy on the necks of Gods people) of which <hi>metaphoricall</hi> expreſſion St.
<note place="margin">Act. 15.10.</note> 
               <hi>John</hi> renders us the ſenſe in plain words; by telling us,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.3.</note> 
               <hi>that this is the love of God that wee keep his commandements,</hi> namely thoſe delivered to us by his <hi>ſon Chriſt,</hi> whom he had commanded all to hear; and which commandements (eſpecially as ſweetned with the hopes of the former reward) <hi>are not grievous</hi> as he there affirmes:
<note place="margin">Math. 17.5.</note> yea in the keeping of theſe it is that the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> makes the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to conſiſt, telling us that <hi>he that ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.4.</note> he knoweth him and keepeth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169709:120"/>not his commandements is a lyar and the trut his not in him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians.</note> There are ſome (I know) that have found out ſhorter and eaſier wayes (as they imagin) to the kingdome of heaven; who not onely think the former courſe unneceſſary for any to engage themſelves in, but ordinarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry the preſſing and perſwading thereof, as that which tends to the ſetting up (as they call it) of <hi>ſelf-righteouſneſſe;</hi> and to detract from <hi>Chriſt</hi> that honour which they conceive can onely by a <hi>confident reliance on him ſeparated from all ſuch qualifications in our ſelves truly redound to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though wee may well admire how this <hi>opinion</hi> ſhould ever come to attain ſo much credit as to gain any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or how the patrons of it ſhould come to have ſuch boldneſſe to vent it with that confidence as they have done when wee conſider what a flat and direct oppoſition it beares to the main current of the <hi>goſpel;</hi> and particularly to thoſe 3 <hi>chapters in Math.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 5.6.7.</note> wherein our <hi>Saviours</hi> ſermon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and to the <hi>firſt epiſtle of John;</hi> yet I cannot but acknowledge this cauſe of wondring to be much abated, when
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169709:120"/>I conſider withall the anſwerable oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that there is betwixt thoſe <hi>lawes of Chriſt,</hi> and the ſenſuall deſires that are naturally in men; which being alwayes ready at hand to put men on ſuch wayes as are moſt pleaſing, or leaſt diſtaſtfull to the fleſh, it is no marvell if the ſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſo far prevail ſome time on the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to perſwade it to paſſe ſentence on their ſide; that is, to judge ſuch wayes moſt ſafe and warrantable, which are moſt pernicious, and damnable in themſelves.</p>
            <p>This is to be reckond the true originall cauſe I conceive of the foreſaid <hi>opinion,</hi> and of mens reſoluteneſs in holding it: Moſt are deſirous to come to heaven, by as ſhort and eaſy a courſe as may bee; and they very well know that it is <hi>longum iter per praecepta,</hi> a very tedious and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult voyage thither by the way of <hi>Chriſts commandes,</hi> that is, onely by the conſtant and continued expreſſions of the former <hi>Godlineſſe, righteouſneſſe, &amp; ſobriety</hi> to look for (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> requires wee ſhould) the <hi>bleſſed hope</hi> promiſed; what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell then is it if this <hi>deſire</hi> and this <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> joined together in them, make them willing to find out and entertain ſuch opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as promiſe heaven upon eaſier
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169709:121"/>terms than ſuch harſh conditions? what marvell is it if upon this ground among the <hi>many figurative,</hi> and ſome of them obſcure formes of ſpeech, wherewith the <hi>ſcripture</hi> abounds, ſome be underſtood in ſuch a ſenſe, as makes our <hi>proper, and perſonall obedience to the lawes of Chriſt,</hi> a thing unneceſſary in this kind? eſpecially when (as in this caſe through the cunning of the falſe <hi>angel of light</hi> it is pretended) by ſuch a ſenſe and inference from it, the honour of <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be thought to be better provided for, he having hereby that glory at leaſt implicity aſcribed to him, of ſaving us ſo perfectly by his own <hi>merits and righteouſneſſe,</hi> as not to ſtand upon any thing to be performed by us.</p>
            <p>But as (I ſuppoſe) all will grant, there are ſome things ſo clearly affirmed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that if an <hi>angel from heaven</hi> ſhould teach us the contrary, wee were not to aſſent thereunto, nor to ſuffer our ſelves to be drawn off the belief of the ſaid things (ſuch as in this preſent matter are theſe poſitions: <hi>without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God;
<note place="margin">Heb. 12. Joh. 3. Math. 7.</note> except a man be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate he cannot enter into the kingdome of heaven; hee that hears Chriſts words, and doth them not, is like unto a fooliſh
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169709:121"/>man &amp;c.</hi>) ſo I anſwerably conceive, if there be any <hi>opinion</hi> which either expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or by it's <hi>naturall force and conſequence</hi> ſhall contradict ſuch things ſo affirmed, or the plain meaning of the ſaid poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, making heaven truly poſſible to be come at <hi>without holineſſe,</hi> or <hi>being rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, or doing of Chriſts words,</hi> it is without ſcruple to bee rejected, what ever <hi>numbers of adherents,</hi> or <hi>preſcription of time, or ſeeming colour of ſome other parts of Scripture,</hi> it may have for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending and upholding the credit of it: It is moſt certain, and ſo generally alſo acknowledged, that the <hi>goſpel, the oracle of truth,</hi> admits no reall contradictions betwixt any of the parts of it; and it is (I conceive) or ought to be not much leſſe certain, that the true ſenſe of the foreſaid <hi>poſitions,</hi> together with thoſe <hi>other formes of ſpeech</hi> to the ſame effect, wherewith the <hi>Scripture</hi> plentifully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, is no other but this which the words plainly and in their <hi>literall ſenſe</hi> hold forth; namely that <hi>our perſonall, and actuall obſerving of the words, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt, is preciſely requiſite to conſtitute us heirs of ſalvation;</hi> or (which comes all to one) <hi>that, without holineſſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169709:122"/>and our being regenerate perſons, which implyes a reall, and univerſall change of of our courſes and affections, the kingdom of heaven is not to be attained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now who ſees not that if there be any other expreſſions of the ſaid <hi>Scripture</hi> (as ſome few I acknowledge there are) that may in themſelves ſeem capable of a contrary ſenſe, that is, ſo as to afford and allow men hopes of ſalvation upon eaſier tearmes than doing of <hi>Chriſts words,</hi> or having ſuch an effectuall change wrought in themſelves; who may not ſee hence (I ſay) that there is a neceſſity of underſtanding the ſaid expreſſions in another ſenſe, than that which ſhall evidently contradict the plain meaning of the foreſaid plain, and plentifull aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions? ſhould not the fewer places (as in this matter they certainly are) be rather brought to a conformity with the more, than the more be bended to the fewer, eſpecially when (as in this caſe it will be found) the ſenſe of the more conſidered ſingly, and with reference to one another, is plain, and rationall, and eaſy to be apprehended; but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to that which is the ſeeming or ſuppoſed ſenſe of the fewer becomes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169709:122"/>irrationall or intricate? ſhould not the plain, and frequent expreſſions of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> on this ſubject, rather make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidently hold, that our <hi>own perſonall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi> of thoſe things commanded us by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is <hi>indiſpenſably neceſſary</hi> for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of ſalvation; than ſome dark and figurative formes of ſpeech incline us to hold the contrary, and make us promiſe our ſelves heaven without ſuch perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, upon I know not what ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>reliance on Chriſts merits?</hi> ſurely in reaſon it ſhould be ſo, and ſo it would be (I doubt not) in this caſe but for the forementiond cauſe, namely that men being willing to come to heaven with as much eaſe as may be, are eaſily tempted to believe the eaſieſt way thither to be the beſt, and therefore through the devills cunning are ſoon perſwaded to take more notice, and more ſtifly inſiſt on one text ſeemingly making that way, than on twenty other implying the contrary.</p>
            <p>As for that which is pretended, that this way of preſſing obedience to <hi>Chriſts lawes,</hi> or requiring our own perſonall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, as neceſſary to ſalvation, is that which tends to diſhonour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and makes for the exalting of our ſelves, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169709:123"/>ſetting up that which ſome call <hi>ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This (I ſay) is a very groundleſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and if thorowly looked into, will appear to be but a <hi>plauſible artifice</hi> of the great <hi>impoſtour,</hi> not of ſtrength ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to deceive any, but thoſe that are in effect willing to be deluded by it: for doth not our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf plainly enough tell us, that this indeed onely is the way whereby wee can truly honour him, and that all verball profeſſions, and magnifyings of him with high titles, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the former performances, are but empty <hi>formalities,</hi> which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not? as where he ſaith not <hi>they that ſay unto me,

<note place="margin">Joh. 15.8.</note> 
               <hi>that herein is his Father

               <note place="margin">Ver. 9.</note> and that, <hi>by keeping his commandements we can only abide in his love:</hi> the keeping of thoſe, being that wherein St.
<note place="margin">1 John 5.3.</note> 
               <hi>John</hi> makes the love of God (from whence only our honouring of him can proceed) truly to conſiſt.</p>
            <p>By thus doing, we give <hi>Chriſt</hi> that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which belongs to him as our <hi>Lord, and King,</hi> in regarding and ſubmitting our ſelves to his <hi>laws;</hi> we give him alſo hereby that honour, which belongs to him as our <hi>purchaſer, and redeemer,</hi> in limiting our ſelves to his ſervice, he having for this purpoſe by the expence of his blood bought us (or done that which is ſufficient for ſo buying us) out of our former ſervitude to ſin; and laſtly we give him hereby that honour which is due to him as the <hi>Apoſtle of our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 3.1.</note> or as that great prophet and ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour immediatly ſent from God, to reveal and promiſe us that <hi>eternall life,
<note place="margin">1 John 1.2.</note> which was before with the Father</hi> (that is, hid in his decree) by ſhewing our ſelves hereupon ſo undoubtedly to believe this, as to prefer the expectation of it, before all our preſent intereſts and worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments; which thing, by our keeping
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169709:124"/>of his words, we muſt needs, and can only ſo ſhow.</p>
            <p>Neither is there any danger hereby of ſetting up (as is pretended) <hi>ſelf-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> this tearm being rightly underſtood: If we had indeed, unallured by thoſe vaſt and divine promiſes which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath made and confirmed to us from God, and unſollicited by thoſe admirable perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive arguments, exhibited in his <hi>life, death, riſing, and exaltation,</hi> rendred (as wee were bound) an exact and uniform obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the righteous laws of God, we ſhould ſo have had that which might be properly called <hi>ſelf-righteouſneſs,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (on this ſuppoſall) wrought out and from our ſelves; though this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo wrought being no more but out duty and homage, for what we had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received, could only of it ſelf, and ſeparated from Gods free promiſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding it, have given us this matter of glorying; namely, to challenge as of right thereby belonging to us, <hi>an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from puniſhment:</hi> but now that that obedience which we perform to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, is of right to be reckond to owe its originall to the fore-alleged cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that is, to thoſe things, ſaid and done
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169709:124"/>and tranſacted in and by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo lived (and perhaps very long) in many great and continued violations of the ſaid commands before the divine force of the ſaid things could have its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon us, as that righteouſneſs, which we thus exhibit by our performance of thoſe commands, is in regard of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer unrighteouſneſs going before, far from ſuch a righteouſneſs as may afford us occaſion of the former glorying, that is, to exempt us from all puniſhment, by the vertue of it; ſo it is to be acknowledged for whatſoever perfection it, hath to be derived to, and wrought in us, by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> he being by the foreſaid means, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour and procurer thereof in us: and therefore it is not to be called <hi>our own,</hi> or <hi>ſelf-righteouſneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> but (as the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſtiles it) <hi>the righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> (or rather, <hi>which is through the faith of Chriſt</hi>) ſpringing in us from him, as the <hi>fountain and cauſe of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hereupon the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſayes, that <hi>Chriſt is made unto us righteouſneſs,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> in the ſame manner as <hi>he is made to us wiſdom, and ſanctification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> (for all theſe are together affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of him) that is, ſo as to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169709:125"/>of that, like as he is of theſe in us; we having thorowly digeſted <hi>Chriſts do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> in our ſelves become hereby truly righteous, as we are thereby alſo truly or really (and not only in eſteem or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) wiſe, and ſanctified, and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med perſons; but in regard it is from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that we are ſo, who in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer admirable manner, and to himſelf chargeable way, hath made us ſuch perſons; all the glory of our being ſo is of right to be aſcribed not to our ſelves, but to him.</p>
            <p>If any yet ſhall be ſo <hi>over-criticall,</hi> as to call this righteouſneſs (notwithſtanding its thus proceeding from <hi>Chriſt</hi>) becauſe truly and perſonally in us and acted by us, our <hi>own or ſelf-righteouſneſs;</hi> though I may tell ſuch a perſon, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> (with which ſure it cannot but be fitteſt, and ſafeſt to ſpeak in divine matters) owns not the word in this <hi>notion,</hi> nor truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords any ground for ſo underſtanding it: yet being not willing to conteſt with any about words, I ſhall conſent that for the alleged cauſes it may <hi>logically</hi> enough be called ſo; but then I muſt adde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that as ſuch a <hi>ſelf-righteouſneſs</hi> for the fore-mentiond reaſons yields no true
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169709:125"/>ground of glorying to us, or of challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging any thing of God, by the merit of it, ſo it is an <hi>indiſpenſable</hi> condition on our part, without which heaven cannot be attained: and this (not to inſiſt on former proofs) our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath in effect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly told us, by ſaying,
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.20</note> 
               <hi>except your righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> (by which ſure is meant, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall and inherent, and ſo far <hi>a ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi>) <hi>exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſes ye ſhall not enter into the kingdom of heaven:</hi> and to this, I ſhall only adde one proof more, taken from the <hi>epithite</hi> or <hi>concrete</hi> appellation, <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> The ſervants of God in <hi>Scripture</hi> are often called by this name,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.18.</note> and all that are deſigned for ſalvation are comprized under this title or denomination of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;</hi> which tearm that it implies not any <hi>imaginary righteouſneſs</hi> without us, nor that which is only <hi>intentionally,</hi> and ſo ineffectually within us, but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>call and ſolid righteouſneſs, truly exiſtent in, and acted by us, St. <hi>John</hi> ſufficiently informs us, when he gives this deſcription of it (prefixing a caution that none draw us to think otherwiſe) <hi>he that doth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is righteous:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 3.7.</note> by all which it may appear, that as it is requiſite for our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169709:126"/>the kingdom of heaven, that <hi>we be righteous;</hi> ſo it is a like requiſite, that we actually <hi>doe righteouſneſs,</hi> that wee may be truly ſtiled with this title; and ſo that a <hi>ſelf-righteouſneſs</hi> in this ſenſe is neceſſarily required of us.</p>
            <p>There are yet ſome other impreſſions (I conceive) to be ſuppoſed in the minds of many; which ſo long as they remain, cannot but proportionably hinder the digeſting of that perſwaſion, which it is my deſign to commend: and they are ſuch, as we may imagin have been wrought eſpecially by the force of two <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is that paſſage in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the late <hi>Common Prayer Book. At what time ſoever a ſinner doth repent him of his ſin, from the bottom of his heart, I will put all his wickedneſs out of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The example of the penitent thief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To either of which, being of common influence, I ſhall endeavour to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, which may be at once ſerviceable for ſtopping the ill uſe that is made of both, and for further clearing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the matter in hand.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Touching the former; though <hi>that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169709:126"/>book</hi> in reſpect of publike uſe be now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authorized, yet it is probable not only that ſome retain ſtill a reverend eſteem of it, and of moſt things contained in it, but alſo that that <hi>ſentence</hi> is freſh ſtill in the memories of moſt, and ſo apt (with ſome at leaſt) to keep them in this perſwaſion (which ſeems to be the direct and naturall meaning of it) that <hi>repentance</hi> or unfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned grieving for ſins paſt, and a like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of avoiding them for the future (for this is that which moſt have been wont to underſtand by <hi>repentance</hi>) at what time ſoever, even though ſo late, as there is not poſſibility of putting ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention into act, will be acceptable with God, for obtaining full remiſſion of ſins, and ſo for ſalvation.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall deſire thoſe, who upon this ground are willing to be poſſeſſed with this perſwaſſion, for a ſufficient conſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, only to look into and ſeriouſly conſider that place in <hi>Ezek,</hi> from whence that ſentence is pretended to be taken; where the words are theſe;
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.21.22.</note> 
               <hi>If the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all my Statutes, and doe that which is lawfull and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye, all his

Is it not plain hence, that beſides, and after <hi>the turning from all our ſins</hi> (which ſeemes all that is intended to be ſignified by that phraſe of <hi>repenting of them from the bottome of our heart</hi>) there is expreſſely required a <hi>keeping of all Gods statutes, and doing that which is lawfull and right,</hi> (of which there is no mention at all in that ſaying in the <hi>Common prayer-book</hi>) as a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for attaining that remiſſion of ſins and life there promiſed?</p>
            <p>I am willing to ſuppoſe that thoſe who were authors of that <hi>liturgy,</hi> and ſo of this <hi>ſaying</hi> in it, knew how by the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acception of the word, <hi>repent,</hi> to reconcile in ſenſe this ſaying, and the next together; and ſo were able thereby to vindicate themſelves from that, which might ſeem otherwiſe to be juſtly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169709:127"/>upon them herein, namely, <hi>wilfull falſifying or perverting the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> yet as I can ſee no true reaſon, why pretending (as they did) to deliver the <hi>unqueſtionable ſenſe of the Spirit of God,</hi> they ſhould ſo far neglect the words certainly dictated from this Spirit, as in ſtead thereof to uſe in this matter, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions wholly of their own framing: ſo I cannot but think that their thus doing, and rendring or reciting that text as they have done, was and is ſtill (eſpecially conſidering the former corrupt notion of <hi>repentance,</hi> that many have been, and yet are ordinarity poſſeſſed with) a moſt dangerous rock; at once to harden and continue men in their ſins, and to make them (but moſt deceitfully) promiſe themſelves heaven, upon ſome late inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall mourning for them at the laſt, notwithſtanding their continuance in them, till that time.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169709:128"/>before the time of their dying; even in a manner all their life time, having been ſo long conſtant profeſſours of him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This thief,</hi> after his faith or declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed profeſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> had no ſpace left him for correcting, or changing his courſe of life; whatſoever good he could do then on the croſſe, he did it, as <hi>in rebuk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his fellow thief; acknowledging the juſtice of his own and his ſufferings; aſſerting Chriſts innocency;</hi> and by his praying to him giving him divine <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and expreſſing his faith in him;</hi> but the fore-mentiond perſons are ſuch, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their <hi>profeſſion of Chriſt,</hi> have large ſpaces, or proportions of time afforded them (their <hi>profeſſion</hi> ordinarily begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with their firſt uſe of reaſon, and ſo running on in an eeven line with their lives) and yet they could never find any ſeaſon for ſetting effectually about the work of reforming their lives, that is, for thorowly obſerving <hi>Chriſts lawes</hi> in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring that obedience thereunto, which was both poſſible for them, and they made profeſſion of: their practiſe hitherto (namely, till the approaching time of their death) hath been a <hi>contradiction of ſuch their profeſſion;</hi> and ſo their <hi>religion</hi>

            <p>There is an uſuall ſaying, that <hi>true repentance is never too late,</hi> or (which comes all to one) that it is and will be alwaies profitable: and this I ſhall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily grant, taking <hi>true repentance</hi> in that ſenſe, wherein I have expreſſed it, which I conceive is only truly ſo: but then, I muſt adde withall, that it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too late for having this <hi>repentance,</hi> or that this <hi>repentance</hi> is not alwaies du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this life poſſible; and the not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of it is cauſed either</p>

               <hi>poſſible;</hi> but yet it is to be denied that it is or will be alwaies profitable: the <hi>Jſraelites</hi> after they had provoked God in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs thus repented, that is, <hi>they mourned greatly</hi> upon the report made by <hi>Moſes</hi> to them of Gods intention for cutting them ſhort of that land of <hi>Canaan</hi> formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them;

            <p>If any be yet unſatisfied with theſe proofs, and willing ſtill to promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others, upon <hi>their unfeigned mourning for their ſins, and praying for the pardon of them</hi> (when as yet they have not effectually left the ſaid ſins, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the contrary obedience required of them) a happy iſſue; that is, ſo as to be accepted with God, and have eternall life conferred on them: I ſhall deſire them to conſult, and ſeriouſly conſider theſe places, <hi>John</hi> 9.31. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.11,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169709:132"/>14.14.11, 12. <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, <hi>to the end. Deut.</hi> 28.63. by which I conceive, if they will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhut their eyes, they may be at once convinced to acknowledge this for a groſſe, as well as dangerous errour; and withall diſcern, that is is not alwayes, and for all, a time of grace, or mercy, during this life; but that there is alſo a time of ſeverity, and puniſhment here, namely, when God will be ſo far from taking pity on ſome (that is, on all thoſe, <hi>who refuſed to hear his calls, and would none of his counſel, not chooſing the fear of the Lord, but the wayes of their own heart, and of the world to walk in</hi>) as even to take pleaſure in their diſtreſſe, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere them with ſcorn, and deriſion when they ſhall moſt ſadly, and ſeriouſly call upon him.</p>
            <p>But this perhaps will be interpreted a way to drive men to deſpair, thus to deny to the <hi>mourning penitent</hi> who hath not now time to change his courſe of life, all hopes of pardon and acceptance with God; and that becauſe he hath not hitherto made ſuch change, though now he truly intends to do it, if time would ſerve him: why may wee not think that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169709:133"/>ſuch intention will be accepted with God for the act it ſelf?</p>
            <p>In anſwer whereunto I ſay, I. <hi>by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that there is a <hi>deſpair,</hi> which may very eaſily be the reſult of this doctrine, and that is, when men knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not to be ſuch perſons, as they are hereby taught it is neceſſary for them to be to come to the kingdome of heaven, namely <hi>new creatures, and ſuch as walk in the commandements of God;</hi> they ſhall hereupon conceive, that there is no hopes for them, remaining thus unqualified, of coming to that place: but <hi>ſuch deſpair</hi> makes nothing at all for the diſcredit, but rather for the honour of the ſaid doctrine; it being that which the goſpel every where in a manner tends to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, by telling us, <hi>that without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God</hi> and many other ſayings to the like effect: this <hi>kind of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair</hi> is moſt deſervedly incurred; neither do ſuch perſons offend God becauſe they fall into it; but rather they fall into it, becauſe they have offended him; it being properly not a <hi>ſin, but a puniſhment of ſin.</hi>

            <p n="2">2 Though for ſuch perſons, whoſe former wayes have not been known to

            <p>Now in this <hi>preſent caſe</hi> the matter is far otherwiſe: the perſon who (as wee ſuppoſe) is now <hi>in extremis,</hi> or a dying, hath indeed nothing poſſible for him to perform towards the <hi>amending,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of his life,</hi> beyond <hi>vows</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes;</hi> but this is a thing that ought to have been done of him before; God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it, and having afforded him ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time and means for the doing of it: it is a thing alſo, that all the time he made profeſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or of his word, he is to be ſuppoſed virtually to have profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and made ſhow of doing: it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not only his own fault, that it is not done, that is, that ſuch <hi>intention</hi> hath not hitherto been acted; but it is alſo ſuch a fault, as is made up of a <hi>continued belying of his profeſſion;</hi> and therefore ſure, there can be but ſmall cauſe, for any to flatter themſelves, or others in this caſe, that ſuch intention ſhall ever bee accepted with God for the act:
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.7.</note> no, <hi>God will not be mocked, that which a man ſoweth that ſhall he reap;</hi> that is, according to our works in our life time, not our <hi>intentions,</hi> at or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169709:137"/>near our death, our future doom is to be expected.</p>
            <p>If any now ſhall queſtion hereupon, what proportion of our time or lives is abſolutely neceſſary to be ſpent in the ſervice, and obedience of Chriſt for this end, to render us actually capable, and <hi>heirs of Salvation?</hi> I ſhall endeavour thus far to ſatisfy him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By telling him <hi>negatively,</hi> that ſuch proportion (I conceive) cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly determined; ſo as definitely to ſet down, that a man muſt neceſſarily ſuch a certain number of months, or years, exhibit ſuch obedience, or elſe he cannot be ſaved: as in the <hi>parable of the hired Servants, Math.</hi> 20. ſome were hired, and went into the vineyard, at the ninth, and ſome at the eleventh hour; and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived equall wages with them, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to work in the morning, and <hi>had born the burden and heat of the day:</hi> ſo I grant (though not through the force of that <hi>parable,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. Muſcul.</note> whereof I find ſeverall interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations given, and which good expoſitours apply to quite another ſenſe, as more ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to our Saviours ſcope, than that which is vulgarly apprehended to be the intent of it) that ſome in the evening of their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169709:138"/>dayes, or in their declining age, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come converts, and begin then to render that reall obedience to <hi>Christs laws,</hi> which he requires, and they formerly neglected; and yet be as ſurely rewarded with the glorious reward of eternall life, as thoſe who ſet out as it were, and have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged from their child-hood in this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment may expect to be: though I think not only that ſuch examples are rare; but alſo where they are, they muſt, and will (being ſuch reall converts as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them) out of the ſenſe of their former neglect, be more than ordinarily zealous, and induſtrious in this kind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſay <hi>piſitively</hi> to the former que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; that ſo much of our time is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to be employed in the foreſaid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as we may be truly ſaid at the end of our courſe, to have been <hi>new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts; and to have done the commandements of Chriſt, or to have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the Spirit,</hi> and in ſo walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have finiſhed our race: all which being things that imply not only a change of our naturall condition; but alſo ſuch a change as conſiſts, and manifeſts it ſelf (not in words, or intentions, or ſingle acts,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169709:138"/>but) in a ſolid and habituall courſe of piety and the expreſſions of it: as the preſence of them is ſimply requiſite to this end, that <hi>our judgment,</hi> namely unto life,
<note place="margin">Math. 16.27. Rom. 2.7. 2 Cor. 5.10. Revel. 20.13, &amp; 22.12.</note> may be ſaid to be <hi>according to our works,</hi> (as the <hi>Scripture</hi> frequently ſays it ſhall be:) So it is plain that there cannot but be ſome conſiderable part of our time and lives neceſſarily required (though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not definitely ſet down how much) for attaining and exhibiting the ſame things in our ſelves. It is very hard, or rather ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and unreaſonable to imagine, that God in awarding eternall life to men ſhould only have reſpect in a manner to ſome tranſient vaniſhing diſpoſition of a dying perſon, <hi>as his ſerious mourning for ſin at that time;</hi> when as hitherto he is to be ſuppoſed to have voluntarily perſiſted in the wayes of it; and yet withall, that God ſhould be ſaid in making that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to render to ſuch a perſon <hi>according to his works:</hi> what ground can there be to think, either that <hi>ſuch mourning</hi> (which men may well <hi>in this caſe</hi> be ſuppoſed to be in a great part in a manner forced to, by the immediate approach and fear of death) ſhould be ſo highly conſiderable with God, above all the voluntary and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169709:139"/>long continued courſes in ſin of the ſame perſon; or that being ſo, and God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that is, <hi>for that ſorrow, or for ſome confident reliance on Chriſts merits at that time,</hi> accepting the ſaid perſon to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; God ſhould be ſaid herein to reward him according to his works? when as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in this caſe, no other work of his, but one or both theſe at moſt, is to bee thought of any moment or conſideration with God. As this therefore is unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceive; ſo it is all one to ſuppoſe, that the forementioned change into a <hi>new creature</hi> can be made, or thoſe other things ſignified; <hi>by crucifying the fleſh, and doing the words of Chriſt, and walking after the ſpirit,</hi> can be tranſacted by a dying perſon, or in ſo little a time, as ordinarily each ſickneſs, as is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner and fore-warner of death is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed with. No; theſe things are of greater import, than thus at once, and on a ſuddain to be diſpatched: it muſt be more than the work of a day or a week, or a month ordinarily (and that when we are in our beſt diſpoſition to ſet about it, which ſure in ſickneſs we are not) to put off thoſe old habits of ſin, which cuſtom hath made pleaſing, and after a ſort na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169709:139"/>to us: and inſtead thereof, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the contrary habits of righteouſneſs and delighting to doe the will of God: to waſh away thoſe ſtaines of the ſoul which through the force of <hi>carnall luſts</hi> there inhabiting have been deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in it; and in their place to ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that divine beauty which is made up of the proportionable mixture of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall graces, and is requiſite to make us truly amiable to God: and ſure as hee who conſiders the nature of our life how unfaithfull and uncertain it is (being ſuch as may be terminated every moment, and is often, ſuddainly, and when we leaſt think of it) can think no time too ſoon to ſet about and begin this work; ſo hee who conſiders the greatneſs, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of the work in it ſelf, or 'its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the infinite conſequence of it (the eternall ſalvation, or perdition of our ſouls, depending on the performance or neglect thereof,) will think no wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or diligence, and conſequently no time too much which it is poſſible for him to exhibit towards the managing and accompliſhing of it.</p>
            <p>Now if any ſhall, notwithſtanding all that hath hitherto been ſaid on <hi>this ſubject,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:169709:140"/>(as ſome I conceive will) bee ready to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that this preſſing of works &amp; obedience as neceſſary to ſalvation tends (1) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and the Law (2) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from and diminiſh the privilege of <hi>faith,</hi> and (3) to require of men ſuch a perfection as is not poſſible or very hardly attainable by any man in this life. I ſhall in anſwer reply theſe things thereunto.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is, and ſo ought, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be maintained a great difference betwixt the <hi>Law and the Goſpel:</hi> but the difference is not in this; that the <hi>Law</hi> requires <hi>works and obedience</hi> as neceſſary in this caſe, and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> requires none, (for this to any one that reads the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> and eſpecially our <hi>Saviours Sermon,</hi> on the mount will appear) to be falſe; but that the <hi>Law</hi> thus oppoſed to the <hi>Goſpel</hi> requires <hi>perfect works and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> undiminiſhed with any antecedent ſins, and unſtained with any preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, in the doers of the ſaid works; that is ſuch works as being performed would give a man cauſe of glorying, and make that the <hi>reward</hi> ſhould be reckoned to him <hi>not of grace,
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.4.</note> but of debt:</hi> but the <hi>Goſpel</hi> requires onely, or rather allows as ſufficient in this caſe ſuch works as in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169709:140"/>thoſe reſpects are imperfect that is, ſuch as for the moſt part have many and great ſins going before, and proportionable failings accompanying the doing of them; and ſo can give a man no title but onely through Gods mercy in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reward of eternall life, held forth and ſealed by him in his blood to the doers of ſuch works, that is, to all truly penitent perſons. And from this difference betwixt the works required in the <hi>law and the Goſpel,</hi> there is another ariſeth and that is this; that thoſe works of <hi>the law,</hi> if performed, would conſtitute the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of them equally righteous (they being all in this caſe to be ſuppoſed to have lived without ſin, and to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and perfectly obeyed all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God) but theſe of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> admit an inequality in this reſpect, and that not onely in regard of time, ſome beginning ſooner, and ſome later to practiſe them; but alſo of degrees, ſome by reaſon of ſome naturall infirmities, or the want of outward helps, not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that exactneſs, or expreſſing that fruitfulneſſe, and abounding in the doing of them which others doe: and yet ſo long as they have put off all the <hi>habits of ſin,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:169709:141"/>and perform proportionally to their ſtrength and aſſiſtance the works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs required of them in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (which notwithſtanding their former hinderances they may,) they ſhall be as ſurely hereafter rewarded as thoſe who have outdone them herein by performing the ſaid things in a higher meaſure.</p>
            <p n="2">2 I ſay touching <hi>faith,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> touching the <hi>law,</hi> by a little altering and inverting his words; we do not abrogate but eſtabliſh <hi>faith,</hi> by requiring works and obedience to <hi>Chriſts lawes</hi> in that manner as wee have done. There is indeed a way of urging works with which <hi>faith</hi> is inconſiſtant; and that is, to <hi>require them to bee abſolute and every way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to the law of God, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting or having need of repentance;</hi> in which ſenſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> diſputes againſt them, or rather the poſſibility of being juſtified by them, in the five <hi>firſt chapters of the Epiſtle to the Romans:</hi> and to ſuch works <hi>faith</hi> is oppoſed, yet not as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to another; but as that which is <hi>imperfect,</hi> to that which is <hi>perfect Faith,</hi> therefore (I ſay) being taken in that ſenſe, wherein it hath thoſe privileges of <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and ſo of <hi>ſalvatiou</hi> aſtribed to it,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169709:141"/>does truely include works &amp; obedience (that is ſuch as we have hitherto preſſed as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary) in it: for the clearer manifeſting of which, I deſire it may be obſerved that this word <hi>faith</hi> (like as many other words and phraſes in <hi>ſcripture</hi>) is of various accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being ſometimes uſed in a ſtricter, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a larger ſence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Strictly and properly taken it ſignifies nothing elſe but, <hi>a firme aſſent given to the doctrine,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>that which flowes from ſuch aſſent, namely, an anſwerable confidence and reliance on God and Chriſt:</hi> and it is ſo taken, when other things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the obtaining of ſalvation are added to it; which things ſo added, the more they are, the more is the word <hi>faith</hi> reſtrained in 'tis ſignification.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Largely and more improperly taken, it may either have ſome one or other thing added to it, or elſe be placed ſingly by it ſelf, and yet have ſalvation, or that which is equivalent in ſence aſcribed to it: which notion of it, is ſimply the largeſt; as for example when the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſayes, there remains <hi>faith, hope, and charity,</hi> he takes <hi>faith</hi> ſtrictly ſo as not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz in it the other two vertues; but when he ſayes,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> that in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus nothing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169709:142"/>avails but faith working by love,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note> he takes it a little more largely, ſo as to contain hope in it; and that not without cauſe, for he that cordially believes <hi>Chriſt</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing heavenly and eternall glory to them that obey him, cannot but moſt earneſtly deſire the ſame glory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon hope for it, and truſt in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but when hee ſayes, and proves out of the prophet,
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.5. Rom 1.17. Act. 16.31.</note> 
               <hi>that the juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> and aſſures the Jaylour of ſalvation, <hi>by his believing onely on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> hee takes <hi>faith</hi> in 'its largeſt extent, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing both the former vertues in it, and what ever exerciſes of it or them the <hi>Goſpel</hi> which is the doctrine of <hi>faith</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to or requires of us. So that that <hi>faith</hi> (wee ſay) which through Gods mercy, hath the privilege of <hi>juſtifying and ſaving us</hi> annexed to it, comprizes beſides that which is properly and ſtrictly ſignified by it, that obedience or piety of life, which excludes all <hi>cuſtomes and habits of ſin, and all grievous and voluntary acts of it,</hi> though otherwiſe (as wee have before ſaid) this piety be not in all equall: the truth of which, namely of this large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the notion of <hi>faith,</hi> when it is thus dignified, may appear from theſe following conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:169709:142"/>1. That <hi>diſobedience or impiety</hi> is that which is oppoſed to this <hi>faith,</hi> as the contrary to it, in thoſe words of St. John, <hi>he that believeth in the ſon hath everlaſting life;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is he that (as <hi>Beza</hi> and others render it) <hi>obeyeth not the ſon ſhall not ſee life, &amp;c. John.</hi> 3.36.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe that which is one where aſcribed to <hi>faith</hi> thus ſingly named, <hi>as obtaining eternall life through the means of it,</hi> is elſewere in plain termes aſcribed to obedience, or ſuch piety of life, as wee have mentioned: thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be the <hi>author of eternall ſalvation to them that obey him. Heb.</hi> 5.9 <hi>and, Circumciſion is nothing, and uncircumciſion is nothing, but the keeping of the Commandements of God</hi> (that is all in all) 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19. and again, <hi>neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new Creature. Gal.</hi> 6.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Becauſe it is fully evident from abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and that moſt cleer Teſtimonies of ſcripture, that for obtaining remiſſion of ſins, and ſo eternall life, <hi>repentance,</hi> that is a change of the mind and life alſo to the better (as before hath been ſhown) is ſimply neceſſary; and St. <hi>James</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169709:143"/>teſtifies that a man is not <hi>juſtified by faith onely but by workes alſo joyned with it;</hi>
               <note place="margin">James. 2.14.</note> and demonſtrates this thing by the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> whom St.
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.3.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> proves to have been ſimply juſtified by <hi>faith</hi> by that very ſame place of <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. which St. <hi>James</hi> alſo ſites in this buſineſs: and laſtly becauſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the <hi>Epiſtle to the Romans,</hi> and alſo in that to the <hi>Galathians</hi> largely teaches; that for eſcaping the ſeverity and curſe of the law, and to become partakers of Gods heavenly kingdome, it is altogether ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>that wee walk not after the fleſh,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> but after the ſpirit</hi> which phraiſe, what kind of exactneſſe and piety it emplyes, may be ſeen in the ſaid places.</p>
            <p>By all which (I ſay) it is plain; that <hi>faith</hi> cannot otherwiſe priviledge us from the wrath to come, or entitle us to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly happineſs than as it hath obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or true piety joyned with it; and conſequently that whenſoever the <hi>ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> aſcribes theſe or the like priviledges unto this tearm of <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>believing</hi> ſingly and by it ſelf; it means not <hi>faith</hi> barely in 'tis ſtrict, and proper ſence; but includes alſo and comprizes under this notion the ſame obedience or piety ſo neceſſarily
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169709:143"/>required of us: ſo that this <hi>faith</hi> may be ſaid to be (as indeed it is) <hi>a certain agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate thing made up of faith ſtrictly and properly taken, and of its effects,</hi> that is, ſuch piety and obedience.</p>
            <p>Neither is it without great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant reaſons, that the Scripture thus ſpeaks in this matter; that is, that not only, it rather uſeth (eſpecially when it ſpeaketh of our <hi>juſtification</hi>) the word <hi>faith,</hi> then other words more plainly ſignifying piety of life; but alſo that it underſtands by, and uſually comprizes in this word <hi>faith,</hi> all that holineſs of life, and obedience to Gods commands which is now requiſite under the <hi>Goſpell</hi> for attaining ſalvation; for</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hereby is intimated, that the ſaid holineſs, or obedience proceeds from <hi>faith,</hi> properly and ſtrictly taken as the root or cauſe of it; and conſequently, that it is not of our ſelves, or from the ſenſe of our own duty (as we were bound, and as the <hi>Law</hi> truly required, that we are ſuch holy and obedient perſons; but that, that which is to be reckoned the object, and cauſe of ſuch <hi>faith</hi> (namely the divine promiſes of the Goſpell, promulgated by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and confirmed in his bloud) is that which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169709:144"/>hath originally wrought and produced the ſaid holineſs in us: and ſo, that it is to be imputed to the free grace, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, thus graciouſly making and confirming the ſaid promiſes to us, and thereby exciting us hereunto, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch holy perſons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereby is alſo ſignified, that which hath been before obſerved, namely the imperſection of our obedience; that it is ſuch, as ordinarily preſuppoſes many and great tranſgreſſions, and courſes of unrighteouſneſs going before, and alſo implies, ſome proportionable failings ſtill accompanying it: ſo that it is not from any worth of its own, but from Gods infinite goodneſs, that it comes not only to be accepted, but rewarded, (as God hath promiſed and declared he will) with eternall happineſs and glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By this word <hi>faith,</hi> thus uſed, is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that this very thing addes a great price, or value (as I may ſo ſay) to our works and obedience, though otherwiſe imperfect; and makes that we pleaſe God, namely in this, that we truſt in him, though we have never ſeen him; that we firmly believe his promiſes, eſpecially thoſe, which by the courſe of nature ſeem
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169709:144"/>impoſſible, neither ſuffer our ſelves by any oppoſitions, or any difficultie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, to be drawn from this hope; ſo, by this means giving God conſtantly the praiſe of his infinite power, goodneſs, and truth.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons, we are to conceive it is, that the word <hi>faith</hi> is ſo often ſingly uſed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> when it is intended, (and indeed cannot be otherwiſe) that that obedience, which the <hi>Goſpell</hi> elſewhere plainly requires of us, ſhould be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be ſignified by, and included in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Touching the laſt particular of the foreſaid <hi>ſuppoſed objection,</hi> wherein the exception is againſt that obedience, or <hi>habituall obſervance,</hi> of the moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Laws of Chriſt,</hi> (which we have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to ſhew and enforce as <hi>indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary</hi>) for the ſeeming impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or extraordinary hardneſs of it: though what hath been already ſaid on this ſubject, may in great part ſerve to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the groundleſneſs of this exception; yet for the fuller clearing of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant truth, I ſhall adde ſomewhat alſo directly by way of anſwer to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt then I ſay by this <hi>obedience</hi> or <hi>obſerving Chriſts laws,</hi> I mean truly a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169709:145"/>
               <hi>greater light of perſecution</hi> in the doing of them, than I ſee moſt Chriſtians attain unto, or (as I have cauſe to think) ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend or aim at; and that is an <hi>habituall, and cuſtomary keeping of the ſaid Laws; which cannot be done, without an anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruble care, of knowing, and remembring them:</hi> and which being done, neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excludes the habit and dominion of any ſin, in the ſaid perſon. I am not willing to think them <hi>Chriſtians indeed</hi> who have an <hi>intention and deſire,</hi> to obey theſe laws, and precepts of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but doe not really obey them; neither can I think them, regenerate perſons, and ſo, in a ſalvable condition as yet, <hi>that do not that good which they would, but the evill which they would not, as being in Captivity to the Law of Sin.</hi>

            <p>All which being either formall or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall contradiction cannot agree to the ſame perſon at the ſame time; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently imply, that the temper of that perſon deſcribed in <hi>that chapter;</hi> and made
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169709:146"/>up of thoſe qualities and conditions there aſſigned, is not poſſibly reconcilable to that other conſtitution of a regenerate perſon, marked by thoſe properties elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where extant, which wee have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: no, thoſe doe truly manifeſt the ſtate of this perſon to bee ſuch as wee conceive to be neceſſary to bring any to the kingdome of heaven; and that is, <hi>a ſtate of freedome, from all habits, and courſes of ſin,
<note place="margin">1. Joh. 4.3.9. c. 5.18.</note> and an anſwerable habituall walking in the commandement of God,</hi> and this St. <hi>John</hi> further confirms, when he aſcribes this great privilege, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to ſuch a perſon, ſaying, that hee is ſuch a <hi>one, that ſins not, nor can ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Though I think this perfection, as I have expreſſed it to bee both a <hi>poſſible, and neceſſary condition</hi> in this caſe; yet I am not ſo far a <hi>Chatheriſt</hi> as to think that he cannot be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> that is not every way perfect, or that commits the leaſt offence againſt the precepts of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> neither do I conceive, either the former <hi>notes</hi> of a regenerate perſon, or that which hath been laſt alleged out of St. <hi>John,</hi> to imply, that the ſaid perſon is ſo righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous as never in the leaſt thing to ſin, or offend, but onely, that he hath not,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169709:147"/>(as I have before expreſſed) <hi>the habit</hi> of any ſin, and that he does not live in a courſe of ſin, but ordinarily, and for the greateſt part, abſtains from and avoids the committing of it: and this, I conceive, may ſufficiently appear by theſe following conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That mens actions are eſteemed, and ſo men themſelves denominated, from the greater part of them: thus wee call him a <hi>ſober perſon, and temperate</hi> in the uſe of meat and drink, who ordinarily, or for the moſt part, avoids all exceſſe in in this kind; though ſometimes it may happen, that contrary to his conſtant wont and purpoſe, he tranſgreſſe a juſt meaſure therein; and thus alſo wee call him a <hi>liberall man,</hi> who uſually proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably to his ability, and as <hi>prudence</hi> ſhall direct, gives of his own though ſometimes it may fall out, that in ſome thing he may not be liberall, but may omit there to give where it is fit, and there is truly need of it: and ſo anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, he is to be eſteemed, and ſo is called in <hi>ſcripture,</hi> a righteous perſon, <hi>who doth righteouſneſs</hi> (as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith) that is who ordinarily, practiſeth and is really addicted, to works of righteouſneſs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169709:147"/>in the word; though ſometimes through common frailtie, or inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, hee may do ſomething that is not truly righteous, or agreeable to the ſaid rule.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the word <hi>ſin</hi> in the <hi>new teſtament</hi> is ordinarily wont, and uſed to ſignifie not any one ſingle act of ſinning, but either <hi>ſome grievous offence,</hi> namely ſuch as may argue the perſon guilty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to be involved in others, not light crimes, and which cannot conſiſt with the fear of God in the ſame perſon; or <hi>more and iterated acts of ſinning</hi> as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from theſe places. <hi>Luke.</hi> 15.18. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.2.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.15.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21.13.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe thoſe <hi>places of ſcripture,</hi> which are uſed to ſet forth the ſtate of unregenerate and regenerate perſons, are ſuch as denote an <hi>habit</hi> or <hi>cuſtome:</hi> thus the former are ſaid <hi>to walk and live af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh. Rom.</hi> 8.1.13, <hi>and to live in ſin. Rom.</hi> 6.2. <hi>and to commit ſin.</hi> 1. <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.8. and the latter to <hi>walk and live after the Spirit. Rom.</hi> 8.1, <hi>and to live godlily.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. <hi>and to live according to God.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. v. 6. as the word <hi>live,</hi> notes our manner or courſe of living; ſo the word <hi>walk,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:169709:148"/>anſwerably notes the accuſtomed actions of our life, for as a way is often trod in, ſo that which wee often and uſually do is called our way: and accordingly the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorts us, <hi>that wee ſhould not ſuffer ſin to reign in us, nor yield our members to it as weapons of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Rom.</hi> 6.12.13. by which forms of ſpeech he requires that wee ſhould bee exempted from the reign and dominion of ſin, but not ſimply from every act of it. It is true, according to the ſenſe of <hi>Moſes his law,</hi> the ſingle act of any one ſin ſubjects a man to the curſe, but according to the <hi>law of liberty,</hi> that is, the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> not every act, but every <hi>habit of ſin,</hi> ſubmits us to the ſaid curſe, or eternall death: for if every ſuch act ſhould now doe this, the ſtate wee are now in under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> were to be reckoned a great <hi>ſervitude, not a liberty:</hi> but if the <hi>habit of ſin</hi> ſhould not doe it, the ſame ſtate might bee juſtly reputed a <hi>ſtate not of liberty, but of licentiouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>ſcripture</hi> faith, <hi>the juſt ſhall live</hi> (not by the <hi>merit of works,</hi> but) by <hi>faith Rom.</hi> 1.17 it does ſummarily, and moſt briefely deſcribe the whole manner of obtaining ſalvation, for in it that ſayes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169709:148"/>none other but the <hi>juſt ſhall live,</hi> it ſhews that there is need of <hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi> to ſalvation, and that, ſo much as by reaſon of it, wee may be deſervedly called juſt or righteous; but in ſaying <hi>that he ſhall live,</hi> not by the force or merit of his righteouſneſs, <hi>but by faith,</hi> it thereby declares, that ſo great, and abſolute righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is not ſimply required, as muſt be altogether voyd of any blemiſh, or defect; but if there be any thing wanting to its perfection, it is (through the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſs and mercy of God) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and reckoned as made up by <hi>faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſay, it may appear from hence, that <hi>that perfection</hi> which wee hitherto have preſſed and conceive neceſſary to <hi>ſalvation,</hi> is neither impoſſible, nor indeed ſo hard, but that men, if they bee truely willing to ſet about it, may by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which herein they may expect from God, ordinarily and aſſuredly attain unto it: It is no more in effect but to take upon us <hi>Chriſts yoke</hi> which hee himſelf tells us <hi>is eaſy,</hi> or,
<note place="margin">Math. 11.30. 1. Joh. 5.3.</note> 
               <hi>to keep the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God,</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> tels us <hi>are not,</hi> (that is the keeping of them being ſo underſtood as wee have before expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169709:149"/>
               <hi>grievous,</hi> it is true, both theſe are hard, and harſh enough, in themſelves, that is, taken as ſeparated from that which is held forth in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as the glorious reward and recompence of them: but if we look upon them, as ſweetned with this <hi>allective,</hi> and ſo taſte it, and them together, we ſhall have no cauſe to complain of any ſuch harſhneſs as men naturally imagine in them, yea this will make us, if we truly taſte it <hi>by firmly believing of it,</hi> not onely take delight in the doing, and limiting of our ſelves, to the ſaid commandements; but alſo digeſt all difficulties, by vigorouſly going tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough any dangers, that ſhall oppoſe our doing of them. <hi>The men of this world,</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt cals them) having hopes given them, of ſome vaniſhing, and with all uncertain profit, and apprehending, no other way of coming thereunto, <hi>are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.25.</note> even ſo as to abridge themſelves, in many otherwiſe beloved delights, and expoſe themſelves, to many tedious hardſhips, and hazards: and may we not then well think, that that <hi>certain, eternall and unmeaſurable good,</hi> namely, <hi>the glory hereafter to be revealed,</hi> if it were truely eyed, and hoped for by us,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169709:149"/>would have the like, or rather far greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon us, that is, to derive ſtrength and courage into us, ſo as to make us both inſiſt in the wayes of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to overcome all hinderances that wee ſhall meet with in that way.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, but if (as in the former caſe) there were no grounds left in mens minds, (as the <hi>ſcripture</hi> rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood affordes none) whereon to exſpect, any poſſibility of comming, to the <hi>ſaid glory,</hi> but by the aforeſaid means, that is, the <hi>habituall obſerving of the Laws of God, delivered to us by Chriſt;</hi> many that now content themſelves with very remiſſe and faint endeavours in this kind (as thinking ſuch, through the force of ſome corrupt opinions they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained ſufficient to this purpoſe) would ſo vigorouſly beſtir themſelves about this work, as actually to manifeſt a greater meaſure of perfection in performing the ſaid commands, than yet they have had a ſerious thought of ever aiming at.</p>
            <p>This is that which by this diſcourſe I have laboured to awaken men unto, as conceiving I could not poſſibly do, a greater act of charity for others than to rouze them out of that ſleep (how ſweet ſoever) which is certain to end in death,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169709:150"/>and ſuch I cannot but think that perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be, whereby men believe ſome faint deſires to do well, or late contrition for not doing ſo, or performing ſome one, or other good duty now and then, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any thing elſe but ſuch <hi>habituall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the laws of Chriſt, and change into a new creature,</hi> as we have ſpoke of, to be available for their eternall welfare. Some perhaps, will account this, and ſo diſtaſte it, as too ſharp or ſowr a doctrine; but yet if it be ſound and wholeſom (as notwithſtanding ſuch ſharpneſs it may be, and being rightly examined, I doubt not but it will appear ſo) there will be no cauſe, I hope, for them, to reject it. Moſt things that are <hi>phyſicall</hi> either for reſtoring, or confirming health, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly unpleaſing; having nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, or induce to the taking of them, but onely the hope of the following good: and I had rather be like ſuch a <hi>Phyſitian</hi> that fits his preſcription to the diſeaſe, and neceſſity of his patient, than him that ſhall temper it to the patients humour, or palate: when (as in this caſe) both cannot be provided for; but the diſeaſe muſt either remain uncur'd, or elſe the Palate be diſpleaſed.</p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:169709:150"/>
            <p>If any will, by the light of <hi>the word,</hi> (the <hi>only oracle of truth</hi> in this kind) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſhew me, or others, a ſhorter and eaſier way to the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, than that which I have deſcribed; I am not ſuch a ſtranger to my own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as to think I ſhould be backward (ſuch a way being ſo manifeſted) to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and think well of it. I have cauſe rather to fear, that the apprehenſion of ſuch ſhortneſs and eaſe in the way pretended to be demonſtrated in this manner (though it ſhould not be really, but only ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo done) might tempt me to incline to much too, and in my judgment approve of it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>my judgment</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at preſent as it does, that is, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a belief of that which I have written on this <hi>ſubject,</hi> and therby laboured to perſwade others unto: I hope thoſe that are of a contrary perſwaſion in this matter, will be ſo charitable, as to impute what I have ſo writ not to any <hi>affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of novelty, or of ſeeming ſtricter than others;</hi> but rather to a <hi>ſenſe of that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation and duty,</hi> which in this caſe muſt be ſuppoſed to lye upon me, namely, to doe all that is in my power to convince
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169709:151"/>others, into a belief of that, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo important a truth: it being <hi>not poſſible,</hi> in my apprehenſion of things, for any to be ſaved, but who acts according to it, which without ſuch a belief of it, it is not probable many will doe.</p>
            <p>It is, and alwaies ſhall be my prayer, that God would open the eyes of thoſe who make profeſſion of the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to ſee <hi>ſuch errors in Religion</hi> as are moſt probable to make the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion altogether ineffectuall for their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comfort; that Chriſtians may be <hi>Orthodox</hi> in that, (whatever miſtakes they otherwiſe live in) whereon the <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of their moſt precious ſouls moſt neerly depends; and if this work of mine prove ſerviceable (as I hope in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree it may) to this end, I have that which I aim at, and I deſire, that God (to whom it of right belongs) may have all the glory hereof.</p>
            <p>
